## 3. Key Findings from Founding Affidavit Analysis

### 3.1 Material Non-Disclosures

1. **Timeline Manipulation:** Peter claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 "following" the accountant's discovery of irregularities. The actual sequence was:
   - **6 June 2025:** Daniel provided comprehensive reports to Bantjies
   - **7 June 2025:** Peter cancelled UK business cards
   - This demonstrates Peter cancelled cards **before** any alleged discovery

2. **Bantjies Conflict of Interest:** Peter fails to disclose that Danie Bantjies is:
   - A **Trustee** of the Faucitt Family Trust
   - A **Debtor** to the Trust
   - The **Accountant** for the companies

3. **UK Operations Perjury:** Peter claims UK entities owe money to SA operations. The Shopify invoices demonstrate the **opposite**: UK entities fund SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually.

4. **Revenue Context Omission:** Peter cites IT expenses of R6.7M (2024) and R2.1M (2025) as "unexplainable," but fails to disclose that the e-commerce operations generated **R34.9 million annually**.

### 3.2 Retaliation Pattern

The timeline reveals Peter's actions were retaliation against:
- **Jacqueline** for confronting Rynette about the R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)
- **Daniel** for exposing fraud to Bantjies (6 June 2025)
