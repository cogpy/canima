## 1. AFFIDAVIT REFINEMENT

### 1.1. Jacqueline Faucitt's Answering Affidavit (v7)

**File:** `affidavits_refined/Jacqueline_Answering_Affidavit_v7_Refined.md`

**Key Refinements:**

-   **Section 4 (AD Paragraph 4):** Strengthened the argument regarding Mr. Bantjies's conflict of interest by explicitly listing his multiple roles (Trustee, Debtor, Accountant, Company Controller, Obstructor of Investigation) and citing the breach of Section 9(1) of the TPCA.
-   **Section 5 (AD Paragraphs 6.1-6.5):** Clarified the operational control structure, emphasizing that Ms. Farrar controlled all systems and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's.
-   **Section 6 (AD Paragraphs 7-7.20):** Consolidated the response to the urgency and alleged misconduct allegations, introducing the legal concept of *venire contra factum proprium* to argue that the Applicant is estopped from complaining of a situation he created.
-   **Section 7 (AD Paragraphs 8.4-9.3):** Simplified the response to the financial discrepancies, focusing on the mischaracterization of legitimate expenses and the true financial irregularities (R5.4M stock adjustment, R900,000 unauthorized transfers).
-   **Section 8 (AD Paragraphs 10.1-10.14):** Streamlined the response to the delinquency allegations, arguing that the Applicant's own conduct warrants a delinquency declaration under Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act.
-   **Section 9 (AD Paragraphs 11.2-12.4):** Condensed the response to the UK operations allegations, emphasizing that the Applicant's claims are perjurious and contradicted by bank records.
-   **Sections 10-13:** Significantly condensed the responses to the interdict requirements, urgency, and ex parte basis, focusing on the core arguments (no clear right, manufactured urgency, abuse of process).
-   **Section 14:** Consolidated all remaining allegations into a single, concise section.
-   **Section 15:** Simplified the prayer for relief, focusing on the core requests (set aside ex parte order, dismiss application, declare Applicant delinquent, appoint independent auditor).

**Overall Impact:** The refined affidavit is more concise, legally focused, and easier to follow. The narrative is clearer, and the key arguments are more prominent.

### 1.2. Daniel James Faucitt's Answering Affidavit (v7)

**File:** `affidavits_refined/Daniel_Answering_Affidavit_v7_Refined.md`

**Key Refinements:**

Similar refinements were applied to Daniel's affidavit, with a focus on:

-   **Emphasizing his role as a successful business operator** who built a R34.9M-per-annum global e-commerce operation.
-   **Highlighting the timeline** of events, showing that the Applicant's sabotage began immediately after Daniel provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies.
-   **Strengthening the argument** that the Applicant's actions constitute a breach of fiduciary duty and a gross abuse of his position as a director and trustee.
-   **Simplifying the financial arguments** to make them more accessible to a non-accountant.

**Overall Impact:** The refined affidavit presents Daniel as a competent and diligent business operator who was systematically sabotaged by the Applicant after exposing financial misconduct.
