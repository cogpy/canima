## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Cognitive Synergy of Answering Affidavits: Strategic Analysis for Court Briefing

**Subtitle:** Case No. 2025-137857 - Peter Andrew Faucitt v. Jacqueline Faucitt & Daniel James Faucitt

**Key Information:**
- Complementary affidavits from First Respondent (Jacqueline Faucitt) and Second Respondent (Daniel James Faucitt)
- Each affidavit addresses all 100 AD paragraphs in order
- Individual narratives create cognitive synergy revealing underlying truth
- Material non-disclosures and false statements in ex parte application

---

## Slide 2: Two Perspectives Reveal One Truth Through Timeline Convergence

**Insight:** The complementary affidavits demonstrate immediate retaliation against both respondents after they investigated and exposed fraud, with timeline precision establishing consciousness of guilt.

**Jacqueline's Timeline (Trustee Perspective):**
- **15 May 2025:** Confronted Rynette Farrar about R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate, stated keeping funds would be "profiting from proceeds of murder"
- **22 May 2025 (7 days later):** Shopify data expunged (100% audit data loss)
- **29 May 2025 (14 days later):** Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (Rynette's son's company)
- **11 Aug 2025:** Deceived into signing "Main Trustee" document
- **13 Aug 2025 (2 days later):** Included in interdict as punishment

**Daniel's Timeline (Operations Perspective):**
- **6 June 2025:** Provided comprehensive reports to Bantjies exposing Villa Via fraud (86% profit margin)
- **7 June 2025 (1 day later):** Peter cancelled 15 UK business cards without notice
- **10 June 2025 (4 days later):** Bantjies dismissed audit request, claimed "going on holiday"
- **8 July 2025:** Warehouse sabotaged, destroying R34.9M operations
- **11 Sep 2025:** Accounts emptied (R1.73M transferred)

**Cognitive Synergy:** Both timelines demonstrate systematic retaliation measured in days (Jacqueline: 7 days, 14 days; Daniel: 1 day, 4 days), establishing that the ex parte application was retaliation, not discovery.

## Slide 3: Bantjies's Impermissible Conflicts Create R18.685M Motive to Conceal Fraud

**Insight:** Danie Bantjies held four conflicting roles while owing R18.685 million to the trust, creating direct financial interest in preventing fraud discovery and dismissing audit requests.

**Four Conflicting Roles Revealed:**
1. **Trustee** of Faucitt Family Trust (status unknown to beneficiaries until recently)
2. **Debtor** owing R18.685M to trust (investment payout schedule: May 2026, May 2027, May 2029)
3. **Accountant** ("Bantjes and Company") who allegedly "discovered" irregularities
4. **Company Controller** who gave instructions to Rynette for multi-million rand transactions

**Additional Conflict:**
5. **Commissioner of Oaths** who commissioned Peter's founding affidavit

**Evidence of Motive:**
- Daniel reported Villa Via fraud to Bantjies on 6 June 2025 (unknowingly to perpetrator)
- Bantjies dismissed Daniel's audit request on 10 June 2025 (4 days later)
- Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed her to make R5.4M stock adjustment payments (SARS audit email)
- Bantjies "discovered" irregularities after Daniel exposed fraud to him

**Cognitive Synergy:** Jacqueline discovered Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; Daniel unknowingly reported fraud to him; both reveal his R18.685M debt. Together they establish Bantjies had direct financial interest in preventing discovery and attacking beneficiaries who investigated fraud.

## Slide 4: Control Structure Reveals Peter as Figurehead While Bantjies Held Ultimate Authority

**Insight:** Documentary evidence demonstrates Peter had no operational control while Rynette claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, revealing Peter as figurehead and Bantjies as ultimate controller.

**Peter's Lack of Control (Documented):**
- **No email access:** pete@regima.com controlled by Rynette (Sage screenshots June & Aug 2025)
- **No bank account access:** All accounts controlled by Rynette
- **No accounting system access:** Sage system controlled by Rynette using Peter's email
- **No operational role:** Daniel built and managed R34.9M operations

**Rynette's Control Claims:**
- Claimed to move multi-million rand amounts under Bantjies's instructions (not Peter's)
- Controlled Peter's email address (pete@regima.com)
- Claimed Bantjies instructed R5.4M stock adjustment payments (SARS audit email)
- Sister Linda employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated

**Cognitive Synergy:** Jacqueline notes Rynette's false statements and control; Daniel documents Rynette using Peter's email and claiming to act under Bantjies's instructions. Together they reveal Peter was figurehead while Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant) held ultimate control through Rynette.

## Slide 5: Adderory's Dual Role in Domain Theft and R5.4M Stock Transfer Pricing Scheme

**Insight:** Rynette's son's company (Adderory) benefited from both customer diversion through competing domain and stock transfer pricing manipulation, with timing linked to Jacqueline's fraud inquiry.

**Domain Theft Evidence:**
- **29 May 2025:** Regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (14 days after Jacqueline's inquiry)
- **20 June 2025:** Email from Gee stating she was instructed to send "don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za"
- Domain owned by Rynette's son (via Adderory), not by RegimA
- Diverted customers from Daniel's R34.9M operations to competing domain

**Stock Transfer Pricing Evidence:**
- **R5.4M stock "disappeared"** from Strategic Logistics (46% of annual sales, 10x historical adjustment)
- Same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments
- Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email)
- No corresponding write-off recovery, finished goods inventory shows negative R4.2M

**Cognitive Synergy:** Jacqueline documents domain theft 14 days after her inquiry; Daniel documents R5.4M stock "disappearance" with same type supplied by Adderory. Together they reveal Rynette's son's company benefited from both customer diversion and transfer pricing manipulation, with Bantjies allegedly instructing the payments.

## Slide 6: Manufactured Crisis Through Venire Contra Factum Proprium Establishes Bad Faith

**Insight:** Peter created the problems he complains about by cancelling cards one day after Daniel's cooperation, then complained about missing documentation rendered inaccessible by his own actions.

**Timeline Establishing Manufactured Crisis:**
- **6 June 2025:** Daniel provided comprehensive reports to Bantjies (cooperation with Peter's request)
- **7 June 2025 (1 day later):** Peter cancelled 15 UK business cards without notice
- **Cards cancelled:** 5191, 5225 (paying for Shopify subscriptions)
- **Effect:** Rendered documentation inaccessible through card-based authentication
- **Peter's complaint:** Missing documentation and invoices

**Venire Contra Factum Proprium:**
- Latin legal principle: "to act against one's own deed"
- Peter cannot benefit from problems he created
- Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt, not discovery

**Respondents' Mitigation:**
- Daniel substituted personal card (1927) for RegimA SA
- Jacqueline substituted personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone
- Prevented business collapse despite Peter's sabotage

**Cognitive Synergy:** Jacqueline substituted personal card to prevent collapse; Daniel documents cancellation occurred day after cooperation, not "following" discovery. Together they establish Peter manufactured the crisis (*venire contra factum proprium*), demonstrating bad faith and consciousness of guilt.

## Slide 7: UK Operations Perjury Exposed Through Shopify Invoices and Bank Transactions

**Insight:** Peter's claim that UK entities owe money to SA operations is demonstrably false—documentary evidence proves UK funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually, establishing perjury in ex parte application.

**Peter's False Claim (AD 12.1):**
- "UK branch non-payment and fraud concerns"
- Implied SA → UK payment flow
- Claimed UK entities owe money to SA operations

**Documentary Evidence Proving Opposite:**
- **Shopify Invoices:** UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd, company 10697009) funded SA operations
- **Payment Flow:** UK → SA (not SA → UK)
- **Annual Amount:** R84,661+ annually
- **UK Bank Transactions:** Corroborate Shopify invoices, demonstrate continuous UK funding

**Material Misrepresentation:**
- False statement included in ex parte application to mislead Court
- Omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses (19.3% of revenue in 2024, 6.1% in 2025)
- Created false impression of "unexplainable" expenses

**Cognitive Synergy:** Jacqueline aware of UK company's legitimate funding role; Daniel provides Shopify invoices and UK bank transactions proving UK → SA payment flow. Together they expose Peter's perjury—a material misrepresentation in the ex parte application.

## Slide 8: Six-Month Systematic Sabotage Campaign Demonstrates Premeditation and Coordination

**Insight:** The systematic sabotage campaign from February to September 2025 demonstrates premeditation and coordination between Peter, Bantjies, and Rynette, not the "state of shock" claimed in the founding affidavit.

**Systematic Sabotage Timeline:**
1. **14-15 Feb 2025:** R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (without Daniel's authority as co-director)
2. **1 Mar 2025:** Revenue diversion started (RegimA SA)
3. **30 Mar 2025:** Two years unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide (12-hour deadline)
4. **14 Apr 2025:** ABSA bank letter for revenue diversion (RegimA Worldwide)
5. **15 May 2025:** Jacqueline's debt inquiry (R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate)
6. **22 May 2025 (7 days later):** Shopify data expunged (100% audit data loss)
7. **29 May 2025 (14 days later):** Domain stolen by Adderory
8. **6 Jun 2025:** Daniel's fraud exposure to Bantjies
9. **7 Jun 2025 (1 day later):** Cards cancelled
10. **10 Jun 2025 (4 days later):** Audit dismissed by Bantjies
11. **8 Jul 2025:** Warehouse sabotaged (R34.9M operations destroyed)
12. **11 Aug 2025:** Jacqueline deceived into signing document
13. **13 Aug 2025 (2 days later):** Jacqueline included in interdict
14. **11 Sep 2025:** Accounts emptied (R1.73M transferred)

**Despite Sabotage:**
- Daniel continued paying creditors for six months
- Operations maintained until accounts emptied

**Cognitive Synergy:** Jacqueline's punishment pattern (2 days after signing); Daniel's six-month sabotage timeline. Together they demonstrate systematic execution coordinated between Peter, Bantjies, and Rynette—not "state of shock" but premeditated retaliation.

## Slide 9: Material Non-Disclosures in Ex Parte Application Constitute Abuse of Process

**Insight:** Ten material non-disclosures and false statements in the ex parte application demonstrate abuse of process requiring the order to be set aside.

**Material Non-Disclosures:**
1. **Bantjies's Trustee Status:** Third trustee identity unknown to beneficiaries
2. **Bantjies's R18.685M Debt:** Direct financial interest in preventing discovery
3. **Timeline Manipulation:** Card cancellation day after cooperation, not "following" discovery
4. **UK Payment Flow Perjury:** Claimed SA → UK, actually UK → SA (R84,661+ annually)
5. **R34.9M Revenue Context:** Omitted for IT expenses, created false "unexplainable" impression
6. **Jacqueline's Debt Inquiry:** 15 May confrontation about R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate
7. **Retaliation Pattern (Jacqueline):** Data expunged 7 days, domain stolen 14 days after inquiry
8. **Daniel's Fraud Exposure:** 6 June Villa Via fraud report to Bantjies
9. **Retaliation Pattern (Daniel):** Cards cancelled 1 day, audit dismissed 4 days after exposure
10. **Control Structure:** Rynette controlled Peter's email, claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions

**Legal Consequence:**
- Ex parte relief requires utmost good faith (*uberrima fides*)
- Material non-disclosures constitute abuse of process
- Order must be set aside

**Cognitive Synergy:** Jacqueline reveals Bantjies's conflicts and her punishment; Daniel reveals fraud exposure and sabotage campaign. Together they establish ten material non-disclosures demonstrating abuse of ex parte process.

## Slide 10: Strategic Recommendations for Court Submissions and Counter-Application

**Insight:** The cognitive synergy of the two affidavits establishes grounds for setting aside the ex parte order and pursuing counter-application for Peter's delinquency under Section 162(5).

**Grounds for Setting Aside Ex Parte Order:**
- Material non-disclosures (Bantjies's trustee status, R18.685M debt, timeline manipulation)
- False statements (perjury regarding UK payment flows)
- Abuse of process (manufactured crisis, retaliation not discovery)
- Failure of utmost good faith (*uberrima fides*)

**Counter-Delinquency Grounds (Section 162(5)):**
- **Intentional harm to companies:** Systematic six-month sabotage destroying R34.9M operations
- **Grossly negligent conduct:** Card cancellation without notice rendering documentation inaccessible
- **Breach of fiduciary duty:** To Daniel (co-director, unauthorized R900K transfers) and beneficiaries (trustee attacking beneficiaries)
- **Abuse of process:** Ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and perjury

**Balance of Convenience:**
- Respondents built and managed R34.9M profitable operations
- Respondents investigated and exposed fraud (fulfilling fiduciary duties)
- Respondents systematically sabotaged for doing so
- Respondents substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse
- Respondents support independent forensic audit

**Independent Forensic Audit Should Investigate:**
- Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant + Controller)
- R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics → Adderory → RegimA Skin Treatments)
- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate (unpaid since Feb 2023)
- Two years unallocated expenses (while Rynette controlled systems, Linda employed as bookkeeper, Bantjies was accountant/trustee)
- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers (without Daniel's authority)
- Revenue diversion scheme (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)
- Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation

**Cognitive Synergy Achieved:** The complementary affidavits create progressive evidence revelation—each stands alone as coherent narrative, together they expose the web of Bantjies-Trustee-Debtor-Accountant-Commissioner, Rynette-Adderory-Son-Domain-Diversions, Peter-Trust-Email-Rynette-Bantjies linkages while clearing respondents of all false charges.
