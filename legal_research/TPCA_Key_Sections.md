## Section 1: Definitions

**'trustee'** means any person (including the founder of a trust) who acts as trustee by virtue of an authorization under section 6 and includes any person whose appointment as trustee is already of force and effect at the commencement of this Act.

**'trust instrument'** means a written agreement or a testamentary writing or a court order according to which a trust was created.

**'trust property'** or 'property' means movable or immovable property, and includes contingent interests in property, which in accordance with the provisions of a trust instrument are to be administered or disposed of by a trustee.

---

## Section 2: Certain documents deemed to be trust instruments

If a document represents the reduction to writing of an oral agreement by which a trust was created or varied, such document shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a trust instrument.

---

## Section 3: Jurisdiction of Masters

(1)(a) In respect of trust property which is to be administered or disposed of in terms of a testamentary writing, jurisdiction shall lie with the Master in whose office the testamentary writing or a copy thereof is registered and accepted, and in any other case, with the Master in whose area of appointment in terms of the Administration of Estates Act, 1965 (Act 66 of 1965), the trustee resides or carries on his principal business.

---

## Section 4: Lodgement of trust instrument

(1) Except where the Master is already in possession of the trust instrument in question or an amendment thereof, a trustee whose appointment comes into force after the commencement of this Act shall, before he assumes control of the trust property, upon payment of the prescribed fee, lodge with the Master the trust instrument in terms of which he trust property is to be administered or disposed of by him, or a copy thereof certified as a true copy by a notary or other person approved by the Master.

*Note: Continuing to review for sections on trustee removal, conflicts of interest, and fiduciary duties.*

## Section 5: Notification of address

A person whose appointment as trustee comes into effect after the commencement of this Act, shall furnish the Master with an address for the service upon him of notices and process and shall, in case of change of address, within 14 days notify the Master by registered post of the new address.

---

## Section 6: Authorization of trustee and security

(1) Any person whose appointment as trustee in terms of a trust instrument, section 7 or a court order comes into force after the commencement of this Act, shall act in that capacity only if authorized thereto in writing by the Master.

(2) The Master does not grant authority to the trustee in terms of this section unless-

(a) he has furnished security to the satisfaction of the Master for the due and faithful performance of his duties as trustee; or

(b) he has been exempted from furnishing security by a court order or by the Master under subsection (3)(a) or, subject to the provisions of subsection (3)(d), in terms of a trust instrument.

Provided that where the furnishing of security is required, the Master may, pending the furnishing of security, authorize the trustee in writing to perform specified acts with regard to the trust property.

(3) The Master may, if in his opinion there are sound reasons to do so-

(a) whether or not security is required by the trust instrument (except a court order), dispense with security by a trustee;

(b) reduce or cancel any security furnished;

(c) order a trustee to furnish additional security;

(d) order a trustee who has been exempted from furnishing security in terms of a trust instrument (except a court order) to furnish security.

---

*Note: Section 6 is critical - it establishes that the Master must authorize trustees and can require security. This is relevant to the case as Bantjies was an undisclosed trustee.*

## Section 7: Appointment of trustee and co-trustee by Master

(1) If the office of trustee cannot be filled or becomes vacant, the Master shall, in the absence of any provision in the trust instrument, after consultation with as many interested parties as he may deem necessary, appoint any person as trustee.

(2) When the Master considers it desirable, he may, notwithstanding the provisions of the trust instrument, appoint as co-trustee of any serving trustee any person whom he deems fit.

---

## Section 8: Foreign trustees

When a person who was appointed outside the Republic as trustee has to administer or dispose of trust property in the Republic, the provisions of this Act shall apply to such trustee in respect of such trust property and the Master may authorize such trustee under section 6 to act as trustee in respect of that property.

---

## Section 9: Care, diligence and skill required of trustee

**(1) A trustee shall in the performance of his duties and the exercise of his powers act with the care, diligence and skill which can reasonably be expected of a person who manages the affairs of another.**

(2) A trustee who has special knowledge or skills or who holds himself out as possessing special knowledge or skills shall be void in so far as it would have the effect of exempting a trustee from or indemnifying him against liability for breach of trust where he fails to show the degree of care, diligence and skill as required in subsection (1).

---

## Section 10: Trust account

Whenever a person receives money in his capacity as trustee, he shall deposit such money in a separate trust account at a banking institution or building society.

---

## Section 11: Registration and identification of trust property

(1) Subject to the provisions of the Financial Institutions (Investment of Funds) Act, 1984 (Act 39 of 1984), section 40 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1965 (Act 66 of 1965), and the provisions of the trust instrument concerned, a trustee shall:

(a) indicate clearly in his bookkeeping the property which he holds in his capacity as a trustee;

(b) if applicable, register trust property or keep it registered in such manner as to make it clear from the registration that it is trust property;

(c) make any account or investment at a financial institution identifiable as a trust account or trust investment;

---

**CRITICAL SECTION 9(1):** This establishes the standard of care for trustees - they must act with the care, diligence and skill reasonably expected of a person managing another's affairs. This is the fiduciary duty standard applicable to the Faucitt Family Trust trustees.

## Section 20: Removal of Trustee

**Reference:** https://vdt.co.za/trust/removal-of-a-trustee-who-is-unwilling-to-resign/

### Section 20(1) - Court Application

A trustee may, on application of the Master or any person having an interest in the trust property, at any time be removed from his office by a Court if the Court is satisfied that such removal will be in the interests of the trust and its beneficiaries.

**Key Points:**
- Any person with an interest in the trust property can apply
- Court must be satisfied removal is in the interests of the trust AND its beneficiaries
- This is a broad discretionary power
- Court procedure may be expensive and lengthy

### Section 20(2) - Master's Power to Remove

A trustee may, at any time, be removed from his office by the Master, if:

**(a)** he has been convicted in South Africa or elsewhere of any offence of which dishonesty is an element or of any other offence for which he has been sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine;

**(b)** he fails to give security or additional security, as the case may be, to the satisfaction of the Master within two months after having been requested thereto or within such further period as is allowed by the Master;

**(c)** his estate is sequestrated, liquidated or placed under judicial management;

**(d)** he has been declared by a competent court to be mentally ill or incapable of managing his own affairs or if he is detained as a patient in an institution or as a State patient; or

**(e) he fails to perform satisfactorily any duty imposed upon him by or under this Act or to comply with any lawful request of the Master.**

**Key Points on Section 20(2)(e):**
- This is the most relevant ground for the Faucitt case
- Section 9(1) defines the duty: "A trustee must act with the care, diligence and skill which can reasonably be expected of a person who manages the affairs of another"
- Proof required may include:
  - Failure to attend trustee meetings
  - Failure to respond to communications
  - Failure to act in best interests of beneficiaries
  - Failure to cooperate in managing trust property
  - Conflicts of interest
  - Breach of fiduciary duties

### Section 20(3) - Return of Authority

If a trustee authorized to act under section 6(1) is removed from his office or resigns, he shall without delay return his written authority to the Master.
