## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis demonstrates that Peter Faucitt and Danie Bantjies have committed multiple breaches of fiduciary duties under the Trust Property Control Act, Companies Act, and Close Corporations Act.

## 1. TRUSTEE CONFLICTS AND BREACHES

### 1.1 Danie Bantjies - Triple Conflict of Interest

**Entity Analysis:**
- **Role 1:** Trustee of Faucitt Family Trust (undisclosed to beneficiaries)
- **Role 2:** Debtor owing R18.685M to Peter (investment payout schedule: May 2026, 2027, 2029)
- **Role 3:** Accountant controlling financial systems and giving instructions to Rynette

**Legal Violations:**

#### Trust Property Control Act, Section 6
- **Requirement:** Trustees must be authorized by the Master in writing
- **Breach:** Bantjies' trustee status was undisclosed to beneficiaries, suggesting possible lack of proper authorization or material non-disclosure

#### Trust Property Control Act, Section 9(1)
- **Standard:** "A trustee shall in the performance of his duties and the exercise of his powers act with the care, diligence and skill which can reasonably be expected of a person who manages the affairs of another."
- **Breach:** A person managing another's affairs cannot simultaneously be:
  - A debtor with R18.685M financial interest in the outcome
  - The accountant controlling the financial records
  - An undisclosed trustee attacking the beneficiaries

**This triple conflict violates the fundamental principle that a trustee must act with undivided loyalty to the beneficiaries.**

#### Trust Property Control Act, Section 20(2)(e)
- **Ground for Removal:** "he fails to perform satisfactorily any duty imposed upon him by or under this Act"
- **Application:** Bantjies failed to:
  - Disclose his trustee status to beneficiaries
  - Disclose his R18.685M debt creating conflict of interest
  - Investigate fraud when Daniel exposed it (June 6, 2025)
  - Act in best interests of beneficiaries (dismissed audit request June 10, 2025)

**Remedy:** Application to Master or Court for removal under Section 20.

---

### 1.2 Peter Faucitt - Breach of Trustee Duties

**Entity Analysis:**
- **Role:** Founder, "Main Trustee" (backdated to 1 July 2025), Debtor to Bantjies
- **Control:** None (Rynette controls email, banks, accounting system)
- **Actions:** Systematic attack on beneficiaries using trust assets

**Legal Violations:**

#### Trust Property Control Act, Section 9(1)
- **Breach:** Failed to act with care, diligence and skill by:
  - Sabotaging R34.9M annual revenue business (trust asset)
  - Cancelling cards immediately after receiving cooperation (June 6-7, 2025)
  - Diverting revenue to competing entity (regimaskin.co.za)
  - Emptying company accounts (September 11, 2025)
  - Using trust companies to attack beneficiaries

**A trustee managing another's affairs cannot destroy the very assets they are supposed to protect.**

#### Trust Property Control Act, Section 20(1)
- **Ground for Removal:** Court may remove trustee if "satisfied that such removal will be in the interests of the trust and its beneficiaries"
- **Application:** Peter's actions have:
  - Destroyed R34.9M annual business
  - Attacked beneficiaries through litigation
  - Caused catastrophic harm to trust assets
  - Demonstrated he cannot be trusted to manage affairs of others

**Remedy:** Court application for removal under Section 20(1).

### 1.3 Jacqueline Faucitt - Fulfilled Trustee Duties

**Entity Analysis:**
- **Role:** Trustee, Beneficiary, CEO directing RegimA Skin Treatments
- **Actions:** Investigated R1,035,000 debt owed to Kayla's estate (May 15, 2025)

**Legal Compliance:**

#### Trust Property Control Act, Section 9(1)
- **Duty:** Act with care, diligence and skill
- **Compliance:** Jacqueline fulfilled her duty by:
  - Investigating R1,035,000 debt owed by RST to Rezonance
  - Confronting Rynette about withholding funds from deceased estate
  - Acting in best interests of beneficiaries (Kayla's estate)

**Jacqueline's investigation of fraud was not misconduct - it was the fulfillment of her fiduciary duty as a trustee.**

#### Trust Property Control Act, Section 20
- **No grounds for removal:** Jacqueline has performed her duties satisfactorily
- **Retaliation:** Her inclusion in the interdict (August 13, 2025) was punishment for fulfilling her duties

## 2. DIRECTOR/MEMBER BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES

### 2.1 Peter Faucitt - Close Corporations Act Breaches

**Entity Analysis:**
- **Role:** Member of RegimA Skin Treatments CC, Villa Via CC, Strategic Logistics CC

**Legal Violations:**

#### Close Corporations Act, Section 42(2)(a)(i)
- **Duty:** "Exercise such powers as he may have to manage or represent the corporation in the interest and for the benefit of the corporation"
- **Breach:** Peter's actions harmed the corporations:
  - Sabotaged R34.9M revenue operations
  - Cancelled business cards during active operations
  - Diverted revenue to competing entity
  - Emptied company accounts

**Peter acted in his own interests (personal vendetta) rather than the interests of the corporations.**

#### Close Corporations Act, Section 42(2)(b)(i)
- **Duty:** "Avoid any material conflict between his own interests and those of the corporation"
- **Breach:** Peter's personal vendetta against Daniel conflicted with corporation interests:
  - Used corporations as weapons in family dispute
  - Prioritized attack on Daniel over corporation welfare
  - Allowed Bantjies (debtor with R18.685M liability) to control corporations

#### Close Corporations Act, Section 42(3)
- **Liability:** "A member of a corporation whose act or omission has breached any duty arising from his fiduciary relationship shall be liable to the corporation for:
  - (a)(i) any economic benefit derived by the member by reason thereof
  - (a)(ii) any loss suffered as a result thereof by the corporation"

**Quantification of Liability:**
- **Economic benefit:** Diversion of R34.9M revenue stream to Adderory/regimaskin.co.za
- **Loss to corporations:** Destruction of R34.9M annual business + warehouse sabotage losses + R900K unauthorized transfers

**Remedy:** Corporations can claim both disgorgement of benefits AND compensation for losses.

#### Close Corporations Act, Section 47(1)
- **Disqualification:** "A person removed from an office of trust on account of misconduct shall be disqualified from participating in the management of a corporation"
- **Application:** Peter should be removed from CC membership on account of misconduct
- **Consequence:** Automatic disqualification from managing any CC
- **Cross-reference:** Section 69(8) Companies Act - disqualification extends to company directorships

**Legal Compliance:**

#### Close Corporations Act, Section 42(2)(a)(i)
- **Duty:** Act in interest and for benefit of corporation
- **Compliance:** Daniel built profitable R34.9M business, demonstrating prudent management

#### Close Corporations Act, Section 42(2)(b)(i)
- **Duty:** Avoid material conflict of interest
- **Compliance:** Daniel's UK company (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations (not the reverse)
- **Evidence:** Shopify invoices show UK card 7147 paying for SA Shopify Plus subscriptions (R84,661 monthly)

#### Companies Act, Section 76(3)(b)
- **Standard:** Director must exercise powers and perform functions "in good faith and for a proper purpose"
- **Compliance:** Daniel's actions were:
  - For proper purpose (building profitable e-commerce business)
  - In good faith (cooperated with Peter's requests June 6, 2025)
  - Prudent (4.6% technology costs vs. 5-10% industry benchmark)

**Daniel has not breached any fiduciary duties. Peter's allegations are baseless.**

## 3. GROUNDS FOR DELINQUENCY DECLARATION

### 3.1 Peter Faucitt - Companies Act Section 162(5)

**Mandatory Grounds for Delinquency:**

#### Section 162(5)(c)(iii)
- **Ground:** "Intentionally, or by gross negligence, inflicted harm upon the company contrary to Section 76(2)(a)"
- **Application:**
  - **Intentional harm:** Card cancellations (June 7, 2025) immediately after cooperation
  - **Intentional harm:** Warehouse sabotage (July 8, 2025)
  - **Intentional harm:** Revenue diversion to regimaskin.co.za (May 29, 2025)
  - **Intentional harm:** Account emptying (September 11, 2025)
  - **Result:** Destruction of R34.9M annual business

#### Section 162(5)(c)(iv)
- **Ground:** "Acted in a manner amounting to gross negligence, wilful misconduct or breach of trust in relation to the performance of their functions and duties to the company"
- **Application:**
  - **Wilful misconduct:** Manufactured crisis (June 6-7 timeline)
  - **Breach of trust:** Using companies to attack family members
  - **Breach of trust:** Perjury in founding affidavit (material misstatements)
  - **Fraudulent purpose:** Conspiracy to defraud beneficiaries

**Supreme Court of Appeal in Msibithi Investments (2025):** "Egregious breaches of fiduciary duties that are neither technical nor trivial are sanctionable."

**Peter's conduct is egregious, not technical. The court MUST declare him delinquent.**

---

### 3.2 Danie Bantjies - Companies Act Section 162(5)

**Mandatory Grounds for Delinquency:**

#### Section 162(5)(c)(iv)
- **Breach of trust:** Undisclosed triple conflict (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant)
- **Breach of trust:** Material non-disclosure of trustee status to beneficiaries
- **Breach of trust:** Dismissed audit request when fraud exposed (June 10, 2025)
- **Fraudulent purpose:** Conspiracy to attack beneficiaries while serving as trustee
- **Financial motive:** R18.685M debt repayment dependent on company performance

**Bantjies' position is legally and ethically untenable. The court MUST declare him delinquent.**

---

## 4. STRATEGIC LEGAL ARGUMENTS FOR AFFIDAVITS

### 4.1 Reverse the Narrative

**Peter's Claim:** Respondents breached fiduciary duties  
**Reality:** Peter and Bantjies breached fiduciary duties

**Strategy:** Systematically show that every allegation Peter makes against respondents actually applies to him and Bantjies.

### 4.2 Cite Specific Statutory Provisions

**For Daniel's Affidavit:**
- Cite **Section 42(2)(a)(i) CC Act** when describing Peter's failure to act in company interests
- Cite **Section 42(2)(b)(i) CC Act** when describing Bantjies' conflict of interest
- Cite **Section 42(3) CC Act** when quantifying damages (R34.9M + warehouse losses)
- Cite **Section 162(5)(c)(iii) Companies Act** when describing intentional harm
- Cite **Section 162(5)(c)(iv) Companies Act** when describing wilful misconduct
- Cite **Section 9(1) TPCA** when describing trustee duties
- Cite **Section 20 TPCA** when requesting removal of Peter and Bantjies as trustees

**For Jacqueline's Affidavit:**
- Cite **Section 9(1) TPCA** to show she fulfilled her fiduciary duty by investigating fraud
- Cite **Section 42(2)(a)(i) CC Act** to show she acted in best interests of corporation
- Cite **Section 20(2)(e) TPCA** to show Peter and Bantjies should be removed for failing to perform duties

### 4.3 Quantify Damages with Precision

**Section 42(3) CC Act allows for precise calculation:**
- **Loss to corporations:** R34.9M annual revenue × 6 months sabotage = R17.45M minimum
- **Unauthorized transfers:** R900K (RegimA SA, February 2025)
- **Warehouse sabotage:** Quantifiable based on inventory records
- **R5.4M stock adjustment:** Strategic Logistics "disappeared" stock

**Total quantifiable damages: R23.75M+ (excluding warehouse sabotage)**

### 4.4 Emphasize Mandatory Nature of Delinquency

**Section 162(5) Companies Act:** Court "**must**" declare director delinquent (no discretion)

**Once grounds are proven:**
- Gross negligence ✓
- Wilful misconduct ✓
- Breach of trust ✓
- Intentional harm ✓
- Fraudulent purpose ✓

**The court has no choice but to declare Peter and Bantjies delinquent.**
