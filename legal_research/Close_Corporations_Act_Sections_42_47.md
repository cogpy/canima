## Section 42: Fiduciary Duties of Members

### Section 42(1) - Fiduciary Relationship

Every member of a close corporation stands in a **fiduciary relationship** with that corporation.

**Key Principle:** This establishes that CC members have the same fiduciary duties as company directors, despite the less formal structure of close corporations.

### Section 42(2) - Specific Duties

A member in his capacity as such shall:

#### Section 42(2)(a)(i)
Exercise such powers as he may have to manage or represent the corporation **in the interest and for the benefit of the corporation**.

#### Section 42(2)(a)(ii)
**Shall not act without or exceed his powers**.

#### Section 42(2)(b)(i)
**Avoid any material conflict** between his own interests and those of the corporation, and **shall not derive any personal economic benefit** to which he is not entitled by reason of his membership of or service to the corporation, from the corporation or from any other person in circumstances where that benefit is obtained **in conflict with the interests of the corporation**.

**Critical Application to Faucitt Case:**
- Rynette Farrar's son's company (Adderory) benefiting from transfer pricing scheme
- Bantjies' R18.685M debt creating conflict between personal interest and trust/company interests
- Peter's use of companies to attack beneficiaries (personal vendetta vs. company interests)

### Section 42(3) - Liability for Breach

A member of a corporation whose act or omission has breached any duty arising from his fiduciary relationship shall be liable to the corporation for:

#### Section 42(3)(a)(i)
Any **economic benefit derived** by the member by reason thereof.

#### Section 42(3)(a)(ii)
Any **loss suffered** as a result thereof by the corporation.

**Key Points:**
- Dual liability: Disgorgement of benefits + Compensation for losses
- No requirement to prove intent (strict liability for breach)
- Corporation can claim both remedies simultaneously

## Section 47: Disqualification from Management

### Section 47(1) - Effect of Removal for Misconduct

A person removed from an office of trust **on account of misconduct** shall be disqualified from participating in the management of a corporation, **save under the authority of a Court**.

**Key Principles:**
1. **"Office of trust"** includes trustee, director, member of CC, executor, etc.
2. **"On account of misconduct"** means the removal must be specifically due to wrongdoing
3. Disqualification is **automatic** upon removal for misconduct
4. Only a **Court** can authorize the person to manage a CC again

### Section 47(2) - Court Authorization

The Court may, on application by the disqualified person, authorize that person to participate in the management of a specified corporation if satisfied that:
1. The person is a fit and proper person
2. The authorization would not be contrary to the public interest

## Integration with Companies Act Section 162

### Cross-Reference: Section 69(8) Companies Act

A person becomes **ineligible** to be a director of a company if disqualified under Section 47 of the Close Corporations Act.

**Practical Effect:**
- Disqualification under CC Act = Disqualification under Companies Act
- Creates comprehensive bar from managing any business entity
- Protects both CC and company creditors/stakeholders

## Application to Faucitt Case

### Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent)

**Section 42 Analysis:**
- **No breach of fiduciary duty** - Jacqueline acted to investigate fraud (R1,035,000 debt)
- **Fulfilled fiduciary duty** - As trustee, she had duty to investigate misappropriation
- **No conflict of interest** - Her actions were in best interests of trust and beneficiaries
- **No personal benefit** - She received no economic benefit from her investigation

**Conclusion:** Jacqueline has not breached Section 42 and should not be subject to any disqualification.

### Daniel Faucitt (Second Respondent)

**Section 42 Analysis:**
- **No breach of fiduciary duty** - Daniel built and managed profitable R34.9M business
- **Acted in company interests** - Shopify operations generated substantial revenue
- **No conflict of interest** - His UK company (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations
- **No unjust enrichment** - All expenses were legitimate business costs (4.6% of revenue)

**Conclusion:** Daniel has not breached Section 42 and should not be subject to any disqualification.

### Peter Faucitt (Applicant)

**Section 42 Breaches:**

1. **Failed to act in corporation's interest [42(2)(a)(i)]:**
   - Sabotaged R34.9M annual revenue business
   - Cancelled cards immediately after receiving cooperation
   - Diverted revenue to competing entity
   - Emptied company accounts (September 11, 2025)

2. **Material conflict of interest [42(2)(b)(i)]:**
   - Used companies as weapons in personal vendetta
   - Prioritized attack on family members over company welfare
   - Allowed Bantjies (debtor with R18.685M liability) to control companies

3. **Liability under Section 42(3):**
   - **Economic benefit:** Diversion of R34.9M revenue stream to Adderory/regimaskin.co.za
   - **Loss to corporations:** Destruction of R34.9M annual business + warehouse sabotage losses

**Section 47 Application:**
- Peter should be removed from office as member/director **on account of misconduct**
- Upon removal, he becomes **automatically disqualified** from managing any CC
- This disqualification extends to company directorships under Section 69(8) Companies Act

### Danie Bantjies (Accountant/Trustee)

**Section 42 Breaches (if considered a member or de facto member):**

1. **Material conflict of interest [42(2)(b)(i)]:**
   - Triple conflict: Trustee + Debtor (R18.685M) + Accountant
   - Personal economic interest (debt repayment) conflicts with company interests
   - Undisclosed trustee status while controlling companies

2. **Derived personal economic benefit [42(2)(b)(i)]:**
   - R18.685M debt repayment schedule dependent on company performance
   - Financial motive to support Peter's actions to secure debt repayment

**Section 47 Application:**
- Bantjies should be removed from any CC management roles **on account of misconduct**
- Automatic disqualification from managing CCs and companies
- Material non-disclosure of conflicts constitutes misconduct

## Strategic Importance for Affidavits

### For Daniel's Affidavit:

1. **Cite Section 42(2)(a)(i)** when describing how Peter failed to act in company interests
2. **Cite Section 42(2)(b)(i)** when describing Bantjies' conflict of interest
3. **Cite Section 42(3)** when quantifying damages and economic benefits derived
4. **Cite Section 47** when requesting Peter's disqualification from management

### For Jacqueline's Affidavit:

1. **Cite Section 42(2)(a)(i)** to show she fulfilled her fiduciary duty by investigating fraud
2. **Cite Section 42(2)(b)(i)** to show she had no conflict of interest
3. **Contrast her conduct** with Peter's breaches of Section 42

### Key Legal Arguments:

1. **Reverse the Narrative:** Peter accuses respondents of breaching Section 42, but the evidence shows **he** is the one who breached it
2. **Quantify the Breach:** Section 42(3) allows for precise calculation of liability (R34.9M + warehouse losses)
3. **Automatic Consequences:** Section 47 disqualification is automatic upon removal for misconduct
4. **Cross-Act Application:** Disqualification under CC Act extends to Companies Act (Section 69(8))

---

## Relevant Case Law Principles

Based on the research, courts have held that:

1. **Fiduciary duties are strict:** Even technical breaches can result in liability
2. **Conflicts must be disclosed:** Undisclosed conflicts are per se breaches
3. **Personal benefit is prohibited:** Any economic benefit in conflict with company interests must be disgorged
4. **Disqualification is protective:** Section 47 protects future companies and creditors from proven wrongdoers

---

## Conclusion

Sections 42 and 47 of the Close Corporations Act provide powerful remedies for breaches of fiduciary duty by CC members. In the Faucitt case, these provisions support:

1. **Dismissal of Peter's application** - He has breached Section 42, not the respondents
2. **Counter-application for Peter's removal** - His conduct constitutes misconduct warranting Section 47 disqualification
3. **Damages claim** - Section 42(3) provides basis for quantifying R34.9M+ in losses
4. **Protection of companies** - Section 47 disqualification prevents future harm

The respondents should actively invoke these provisions in their answering affidavits and counter-application.
