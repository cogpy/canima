## Overview

Section 162 of the Companies Act provides a crucial remedy for companies where a director's fiduciary duties are breached. The Supreme Court of Appeal's decision in *Msibithi Investments and Others v African Legend Investment and Others* [2025] ZASCA 61 is a crisp reminder that the ability to declare a director delinquent in terms of section 162 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 has real teeth.

## Key Principles

### Mandatory Declaration (No Discretion)

Once it is established that a director has breached their fiduciary duties by acting in a manner that amounts to **gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or breach of trust**, the court **must** declare the director delinquent. The court has no discretion in this matter.

### Standard of Conduct

The judgment distils the core of delinquency under section 162(5)(c)(iv): **egregious breaches of fiduciary duties that are neither technical nor trivial are sanctionable.**

### Shareholder Dilution

The judgment also makes clear that shareholder dilution will not constitute oppression where decisions are rational and for a proper purpose.

## Section 162(5): Mandatory Grounds for Delinquency Declaration

3. **Breach of trust**

in performing their functions and duties to the company.

### Specific Grounds Under Section 162(5)(c)

4. **Conflicts of interest** that compromise fiduciary duties
5. **Self-dealing** and unjust enrichment at company expense
6. **Financial sabotage** and intentional harm to company assets
7. **Conspiracy to defraud** creditors, employees, or shareholders

### Alternative: Probation Orders

If the court finds that the conduct does not meet the threshold for mandatory delinquency, probation orders under Section 162(7) may be appropriate based on:

1. **Oppressive conduct:** Using companies to attack family members/beneficiaries
2. **Unfairly prejudicial conduct:** Destroying R34.9M business to justify litigation
3. **Materially inconsistent with duties:** Sabotaging companies they are supposed to protect

## Strategic Importance

The provision acts both as a **deterrent** and a **protective mechanism** for companies. The mandatory nature of the declaration (once grounds are proven) removes judicial discretion and ensures consistent application of the law.

The recent SCA judgment in *Msibithi Investments* confirms that courts will not tolerate egregious breaches of fiduciary duties, and that technical defenses will not shield directors from accountability.
