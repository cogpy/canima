## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines recommendations for the legal response of Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt (the Respondents). The recommendations are based on an analysis of the evidence provided. The proposed strategy is to present a fact-based response that addresses the Applicant's allegations in a structured manner, supported by documentary evidence. The answering affidavits for the Respondents have been drafted to align with this approach, ensuring that all responses are substantiated by direct evidence and correspond to the structure of the Applicant's founding affidavit.

## 2. Core Recommendations

### 2.1 Focus on the Timeline of Events

The Respondents' legal strategy should center on a clear and chronological presentation of the facts. The evidence suggests that the disruption to the business operations followed a specific sequence of events, which should be clearly articulated in the answering affidavits. This includes the cancellation of the business bank cards on June 7, 2025, which occurred the day after the Second Respondent provided financial information to the Applicant. The legal principle of estoppel may be relevant here, as the Applicant's own actions may have contributed to the very issues he raises in his application.

### 2.2 Consider a Counter-Application

The Respondents should consider filing a counter-application. This would enable them to seek their own relief from the Court, including:

- **Interdictory Relief:** An order restraining the Applicant from any further interference with the business operations.
- **Forensic Audit:** A comprehensive forensic audit of the Faucitt Family Trust and all related entities, with a specific focus on the R5.4 million stock adjustment in SLG and the profit margins of Villa Via.
- **Restitution and Damages:** A claim for restitution and damages, supported by an expert valuation.

### 2.3 Present a Chronological Account of Events

The Applicant's actions should be presented as a series of interconnected events, rather than isolated incidents. The answering affidavits should detail the timeline of events from March to September 2025, including the diversion of revenue, the cancellation of bank cards, and the instruction to halt warehouse operations. This will provide the Court with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the context in which the dispute arose.

## 3. Recommendations for Affidavit Content

### 3.1 Address Conflicts of Interest

The multiple roles of Mr. Danie Bantjies as trustee, accountant, and debtor to the Applicant should be highlighted as a material conflict of interest. The affidavits should clearly state that Mr. Bantjies was acting in these three capacities simultaneously, and that his status as a trustee was not disclosed to the beneficiaries. This is a relevant factor for the Court to consider when assessing the evidence.

### 3.2 Emphasize the First Respondent's Role as a Trustee

The inclusion of the First Respondent in the interdict, following her inquiry into a significant debt owed to a company associated with a deceased estate, is a key aspect of the case. The affidavits should frame this as a direct consequence of her actions in fulfilling her fiduciary duties as a trustee.

### 3.3 Ensure Clear Evidentiary Support

All factual claims in the affidavits must be supported by clear and properly referenced annexures. The use of visual timelines and tables within the body of the affidavit can also assist in presenting complex information in a clear and concise manner.

## 4. Conclusion

The Applicant's case should be met with a clear, fact-based response that presents a chronological account of events and is supported by documentary evidence. By focusing on the timeline of events, the conflicts of interest, and the First Respondent's role as a trustee, the Respondents can present a compelling case to the Court. The revised affidavits and the recommendations outlined in this document provide a framework for achieving this.
