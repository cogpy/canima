**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Repository:** cogpy/ad-res-j7  
**Master Document:** MASTER_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE_EVIDENCE_PACKAGE.md

---

## THE CASE IN ONE SENTENCE

**Peter's Claim:** "Daniel mismanaging companies"  
**The Reality:** **BANTJIES (TRUSTEE) ORCHESTRATED 4-YEAR INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY** to defraud beneficiaries, silence investigating trustee, steal UK pension assets, profit from murder proceeds, and destroy an altruistic R100M+ transfer to save thousands of livelihoods.

---

## THE REAL POWER STRUCTURE (3 LEVELS)

**Level 1: DANIE BANTJIES (Ultimate Controller)**
- Trustee (Faucitt Family Trust - July 2024, covert)
- Accountant (RegimA companies - financial dependence)
- Commissioner of Oaths (dual role - witness + certifier)
- R18.685M Creditor (first payment due May 2026)

**Level 2: RYNETTE FARRAR (Executor)**
- Controls Peter's email (pete@regima.com)
- Subscription owner (Sage accounting - controls all access)
- Controls all accounts (company accounts, banks)
- Takes instructions from Bantjies (not Peter)

**Level 3: PETER FAUCITT (Figurehead)**
- NO ACCESS to accounts, banks, or email
- R18.685M debt to Bantjies (leverage)
- Puppet with no independent control

---

## THE FIVE SMOKING GUNS

**#1: WAREHOUSE FRAUD (July 8, 2025)**
- Peter instructed warehouse to STOP SHOPIFY ORDERS
- R34.9M operations sabotaged (93.3% revenue collapse)
- POPI violations (10 years imprisonment + R10M fine)
- Proves intent: DESTRUCTION (not management)

**#2: PERJURY (Multiple Instances)**
- Peter: "Erratic behavior" (after 165 days of torture)
- Peter: "Urgency" (67-day delay proves false)
- Peter: "Discovery" (system logs prove 4-year knowledge)
- Bantjies: "No knowledge of crimes" (65-day timeline proves false)
- Exposure: **15 YEARS PER COUNT**

**#3: 2-YEAR ACCOUNTING BLACKOUT**
- July 13, 2023: Kayla murdered → Law enforcement: "TOUCH NOTHING"
- 2023: Court order obtained → Interfered with murder investigation
- 2023-2025: 2 YEARS NO BOOKS (despite Linda employed "just to do those books")
- March 30, 2025: Dump 2 years unallocated expenses (12-hour deadline)

**#4: R5.4M STOCK THEFT**
- R5.4M from Strategic Logistics (SLG) as "stock adjustment"
- Stock "disappeared" → Diverted to Adderory (Rynette's son)
- Negative R4.2M inventory (accounting fiction)
- Theft as Trustee → **LIFE IMPRISONMENT**

**#5: SARS AUDIT EMAIL**
- SARS was auditing and asking about huge amounts
- Rynette said: **"BANTJIES INSTRUCTED HER TO MAKE THOSE HUGE PAYMENTS"**
- Proves Bantjies' ultimate control (not Peter)
- Proves Rynette takes orders from Bantjies

## THE 9-PRONG COORDINATED ATTACK

**PRONG #1 (March 1, 2025):** RegimA SA Revenue Diversion  
**PRONG #2 (April 14, 2025):** RegimA Worldwide Bank Letter  
**PRONG #3 (May 22-23, 2025):** Shopify Orders Removed  
**PRONG #4 (June 7, 2025):** Card Cancellations (SECRET - 15 cards, Jacqui's birthday)  
**PRONG #5 (June 20, 2025):** Client Diversion (regimaskin.co.za)  
**PRONG #6 (Unknown Date):** ABSA Accounts Fraud (8 accounts, Daniel's stolen card)  
**PRONG #7 (Unknown Date):** HMRC Pension Fraud (UK - pete@regimaskin.co.za)  
**PRONG #8 (September 11, 2025):** Account Emptying (R1.73M transfer)  
**PRONG #9 (July 8, 2025):** Warehouse Sabotage (POPI violations - R34.9M operations destroyed)

**THE FORMULA:** ZERO REVENUE + ALL LIABILITIES = FORCED INSOLVENCY

---

## THE UBUNTU PRINCIPLE

**Kayla's Vision (March 2020):**
> "Since the ZA companies helped UK out of the Isaac Chesno problem in 2015, we should find a way to attribute as much of the ZA revenue generated by the UK Shopify platform as possible to the ZA companies even though they were unable to generate it themselves and tell all the staff everything will be ok. Essentially Kayla proposed we give most of the money we made to the ZA companies to protect staff and ensure nobody was left behind."

**The Reality:**
- R208M accumulated on Shopify platform (51 stores)
- R100M+ being transferred to save ZA companies
- 90% complete by May 2025 (weeks from completion)
- Thousands of small businesses depending on success
- Tens of thousands of staff depending on completion
- 30 years of customer trust maintained

**The Destruction:**
- May 22, 2025: Orders stopped, data extraction begins
- June 7, 2025: Card cancellations (financial devastation)
- August 19, 2025: Interdict scheduled for delivery (weaponized grief)
- September 11, 2025: Accounts emptied (R1.73M)
- **90% complete transition STOPPED** (weeks from completion)

- Kayla murdered July 13, 2023 (Daniel's partner)
