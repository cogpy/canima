# THE UBUNTU PRINCIPLE - KAYLA AND DANIEL GIVING AWAY R100M+ TO SAVE ZA COMPANIES AND STAFF

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document exposes **WHAT PETER/BANTJIES/RYNETTE NEVER REALIZED**: Kayla Pretorius and Daniel Faucitt were **GIVING AWAY R100M+** of UK profits to save South African companies, protect staff, and preserve an ecosystem supporting **thousands of small businesses** and **tens of thousands of staff**.

**The Ubuntu Principle (Kayla's Vision):**
> "Since the ZA companies helped UK out of the Isaac Chesno problem in 2015, we should find a way to attribute as much of the ZA revenue generated by the UK Shopify platform as possible to the ZA companies even though they were unable to generate it themselves and tell all the staff everything will be ok. Essentially Kayla proposed we give most of the money we made to the ZA companies to protect staff and ensure nobody was left behind."

**The Reality:**
- **R208M accumulated** on Shopify platform (as of 2025)
- **90% complete transition** by May 2025
- **51 Shopify stores** (Kayla & Daniel as registered merchants)
- **RegimA Zone Ltd (UK)** - Daniel 100% shareholder, owns platform
- **Personal capacity decision** - Kayla & Daniel decided revenue attribution
- **Thousands of small businesses** depend on RegimA ecosystem
- **Tens of thousands of staff** depend on continued success
- **30 years of customer trust** built and maintained

**What Peter/Bantjies/Rynette Did:**
- **May 2025:** Hijacked revenue stream (**STOPPED 90% complete transition**)
- **Destroyed altruistic transfer** (R100M+ being given to save ZA companies)
- **Destroyed ecosystem** (thousands of businesses, tens of thousands of staff)
- **Destroyed 30 years of trust** (customer relationships)
- **Stole from people GIVING AWAY R100M+** to save others

**The Legal Transformation:**

**Peter's Narrative:**
❌ "Daniel mismanaging companies and wasting money"

**The Reality:**
✅ **KAYLA AND DANIEL SACRIFICING UK PROFITS TO SAVE ZA COMPANIES, STAFF, AND ECOSYSTEM**

**Peter/Bantjies/Rynette's Actions:**
- **NOT "protecting companies"**
- **DESTROYING an altruistic R100M+ transfer to save thousands of livelihoods**

---

## THE UBUNTU PRINCIPLE - KAYLA'S VISION

### **The Origin (March 2020 - Lockdown Begins)**

**The Situation:**
- UK Shopify stores conducting pilot tests in ZA
- Sales: **R120,000 per month** (handful of salons & doctors)
- Flexibility of Shopify: Multiple fulfilment centres & supply sources
- E-commerce platform integration

**The Challenge:**
- **First 12 months of lockdown:** All ZA companies effectively **BANKRUPT**
- Entire business running through **UK e-commerce platforms**
- 3rd party ZA fulfilment centre integrations
- All clients operating through **GDPR & POPIA compliant gateways** on UK platform
- **Still paying ZA staff salaries** (despite ZA companies bankrupt)
- Usual daily activities continuing as usual

**The Problem:**
- Need mechanism for clients to voluntarily update accounts on new ZA Shopify platform
- **POPIA requirements:** Each client needs to consent
- **GDPR compliance:** UK platform protections
- **Legal complexity:** How to transfer R100M+ legitimately

---

### **Kayla's Ubuntu Proposal**

**The Principle:**
> **"Ubuntu"** - I am because we are. A person is a person through other people.

**Kayla's Reasoning:**
- **2015:** ZA companies helped UK out of Isaac Chesno problem (£500k+ fraud)
- **2020:** UK should help ZA companies out of lockdown bankruptcy
- **Reciprocity:** What goes around comes around
- **Collective wellbeing:** Nobody left behind

**Kayla's Specific Proposal:**
> "Find a way to attribute **as much of the ZA revenue generated by the UK Shopify platform as possible** to the ZA companies **even though they were unable to generate it themselves** and tell all the staff **everything will be ok**."

> "Essentially Kayla proposed **we give most of the money we made** to the ZA companies to **protect staff** and ensure **nobody was left behind**."

**The Sacrifice:**
- Kayla & Daniel: **GIVE AWAY** UK profits (R100M+)
- ZA companies: **RECEIVE** revenue they couldn't generate themselves
- Staff: **PROTECTED** (salaries paid, jobs saved)
- Ecosystem: **PRESERVED** (thousands of businesses, tens of thousands of staff)

---

### **The Legal Mechanism (How to Give Away R100M+)**

**The Challenge:**
> "The reason everything appears so overcomplicated and messy is the story of how Kayla and Dan discovered how difficult it actually is to **'give away' R100M** while satisfying every legal requirement of taxation and data protection required to do so legitimately."

**The Legal Requirements:**
1. **Taxation:** Minimum admin fees, correct invoicing procedures
2. **Data Protection:** POPIA (ZA) + GDPR (UK) compliance
3. **Revenue Allocation:** Services vs products
4. **Import/Export:** Duties and customs
5. **Company Law:** Legitimate inter-company transactions
6. **Consumer Protection:** Client consent for platform migration

**The Solution:**
- **Administrative invoices** through Rezonance & Unicorn Dynamics
- **Monthly admin fees** charged (minimum legal requirement)
- **Revenue stream transferred** to various ZA companies
- **Stock2Shop ZA** multiplexing 27 store channels into 3 Sage Accounts systems:
  - RegimA Worldwide (UK-owned, transitioning OUT)
  - RegimA SA (ZA-owned, transitioning IN)
  - RegimA Zone (ZA-owned, transitioning IN)

**The Ownership Structure:**
- **Kayla & Daniel:** Registered merchants of all 51 stores (**PERSONAL CAPACITY**)
- **Daniel:** 100% shareholder of RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) that **OWNS THE PLATFORM**
- **Decision authority:** Kayla & Daniel decide revenue attribution in **PERSONAL CAPACITIES**
- **IP ownership:** All IP owned by Jax & Dan **PERSONALLY** (not companies)
  - All product formulations
  - All platform technology
  - All business processes

**The Legitimacy:**
- **Personal ownership** = Personal decision authority
- **Administrative invoices** = Legal revenue transfer mechanism
- **POPIA/GDPR compliance** = Client consent for migration
- **Tax compliance** = Correct invoicing and admin fees

## THE R208M SHOPIFY PLATFORM

### **The Growth (March 2020 - May 2025)**

**March 2020 (Lockdown Begins):**
- Sales: **R120,000 per month**
- Handful of salons & doctors
- Pilot testing phase

**2022 (2 Years Later):**
- Sales: **R1,800,000 per month**
- **15x growth** during lockdown
- Entire ZA business running through UK platform

**May 2025 (Transition 90% Complete):**
- **Total accumulated: R208,000,000**
- **51 Shopify stores** operational
- **27 store channels** multiplexed into 3 Sage systems
- **90% complete transition** from UK-owned to ZA-owned platforms

**The Platform Structure:**
- **RegimA Worldwide (UK-owned):** Transitioning OUT (90% complete)
- **RegimA SA (ZA-owned):** Transitioning IN (steady sales established)
- **RegimA Zone (ZA-owned):** Transitioning IN (ready for completion)

**What Was Needed to Complete:**
> "All we need to do to complete the process is have the warehouse fulfil orders from the Shopify stores as they always have."

**The Completion Timeline:**
- **May 2025:** 90% complete
- **Estimated completion:** Weeks away (just needed warehouse fulfilment continuation)
- **Total value being transferred:** **R100M+** (of R208M accumulated)

---

### **The Ecosystem Impact**

**Direct Impact:**
- **ZA companies:** Saved from bankruptcy (revenue transferred from UK)
- **Staff:** Salaries paid, jobs saved (despite ZA companies bankrupt)
- **Clients:** Seamless service continuation (POPIA/GDPR compliant migration)

**Ecosystem Impact:**
> "There are **thousands of small businesses** and **tens of thousands of staff** in the RegimA ecosystem that depend on our continued success."

**The RegimA Ecosystem:**
- **Salons:** Thousands using RegimA products
- **Doctors:** Medical professionals prescribing RegimA treatments
- **Distributors:** Small businesses selling RegimA products
- **Suppliers:** Manufacturers, packagers, logistics
- **Staff:** Tens of thousands employed across ecosystem
- **Customers:** 30 years of trust and relationships

**The Stakes:**
> "Thus while the Applicant seeks to **sacrifice them all** to satiate his own desires for self-serving enrichment, we must consider the **wellbeing of the entire ecosystem** and all affected parties over and above any harms done to us personally."

**The Priority:**
> "Thus we are doing our best to **fulfil our fiduciary duties** and resume stable operations asap as a priority."

**The Concern:**
> "One of our main concerns is **disruption in continuity of business established over 30 years of customer trust** in the industry - now in jeopardy due to the recent events."

## THE REVENUE HIJACKING - DESTROYING THE ALTRUISTIC TRANSFER

### **May 2025 - The 90% Complete Transition Stopped**

**The Status (May 2025):**
- **90% complete** transition from UK-owned to ZA-owned platforms
- **R208M accumulated** on Shopify platform
- **R100M+** being transferred to save ZA companies
- **Weeks away** from completion (just needed warehouse fulfilment)

**The Revenue Hijacking (May 2025):**

**Phase 1 (May 22-23):** Shopify Orders Removed
- **ALL orders** physically removed from Shopify platform
- **Order data** lost (customer information, revenue records)
- **Warehouse fulfilment** disrupted
- **Effect:** **STOPPED the 90% complete transition**

**Phase 2 (June 20):** Client Diversion to regimaskin.co.za
- Email instruction: "Don't use regima.zone, only use regimaskin.co.za"
- **regimaskin.co.za owned by RYNETTE'S SON** (Adderory)
- **NOT owned by RegimA** (not owned by ZA companies)
- **Effect:** **DIVERTED R100M+ revenue stream to Rynette's son**

**Phase 3 (Earlier - March 1, April 14):** Revenue Diversions
- **March 1:** RegimA SA revenue diverted
- **April 14:** RegimA Worldwide revenue diverted (Rynette's bank letter)
- **Effect:** **HIJACKED the revenue being transferred to save ZA companies**

**The Result:**
- **90% complete transition STOPPED** (weeks away from completion)
- **R100M+ altruistic transfer DESTROYED** (Kayla & Daniel giving away UK profits)
- **ZA companies BANKRUPTED** (revenue stream hijacked)
- **Ecosystem DESTROYED** (thousands of businesses, tens of thousands of staff)
- **30 years of trust DESTROYED** (customer relationships)

**Kayla's Vision (March 2020):**
- Give away R100M+ to save ZA companies
- Protect staff (nobody left behind)

**The Irony:**

- Peter/Bantjies/Rynette: **STEALING from people giving away R100M+**

**The Tragedy:**
- Kayla murdered (July 13, 2023) - **NEVER SAW THE COMPLETION** of her Ubuntu vision
- Daniel continued (2023-2025) - **COMPLETED 90%** of Kayla's vision
- Peter/Bantjies/Rynette (May 2025) - **DESTROYED Kayla's legacy** (weeks from completion)
