# THE 9-PRONG COORDINATED ATTACK
## Systematic Destruction Timeline

**Case 2025-137857: Peter Andrew Faucitt v. Jacqueline Faucitt & Daniel James Faucitt**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Between March 2025 and September 2025, Bantjies (through Rynette and Peter) executed a **9-prong coordinated attack** designed to achieve a single objective:

**ZERO REVENUE + ALL LIABILITIES = FORCED INSOLVENCY**

Each prong was precisely timed and coordinated to maximize damage while concealing the conspiracy. The pattern proves **PREMEDITATION**, **COORDINATION**, and **CRIMINAL INTENT**.

---

## THE FORMULA

### Objective: Force Insolvency Through Financial Strangulation

**Step 1: ELIMINATE ALL REVENUE SOURCES**
- Stop Shopify orders (warehouse sabotage)
- Remove Shopify data (evidence destruction)
- Divert clients (regimaskin.co.za)
- Cancel payment cards (platform collapse)

**Step 2: MAINTAIN ALL LIABILITIES**
- Keep all creditors active
- Prevent access to funds (account emptying)
- Block operational capacity (card cancellations)
- Create new liabilities (legal costs)

**Step 3: FORCE FAILURE**
- Zero revenue + All liabilities = Insolvency
- Insolvency → Curatorship
- Curatorship → Bantjies controls everything
- **R18.685M payment secured (May 2026)**

## THE PATTERN: PREMEDITATION + COORDINATION

### Evidence of Premeditation

**1. Sequential Timing:**
- Each prong builds on previous prongs
- Gaps between prongs (16, 13, 18 days) prove deliberate pacing
- Not random events (proves coordination)

**2. Manufactured Crisis (June 6-7):**
- June 6: Daniel cooperates
- June 7: Cards cancelled (next day retaliation)
- Creates problem Peter later complains about
- **Venire contra factum proprium** (cannot benefit from own wrong)

**3. Psychological Warfare:**
- June 7: Jacqui's birthday (card cancellations)
- August 19: Kayla's birthday (interdict delivery)
- 6-day deliberate delay (interdict granted August 13)
- **Weaponizing grief** (murdered partner's memory)

**4. International Coordination:**
- SA: Warehouse sabotage, account emptying, card cancellations
- UK: Pension fraud, domain registration, email creation
- Proves cross-border conspiracy

---

### Evidence of Coordination

**1. Same Actors:**
- Bantjies: Ultimate controller (SARS email, trustee appointment)
- Rynette: Executor (email control, bank transfers, Sage subscription)
- Peter: Figurehead (signs documents, no independent access)
- Adderory: UK executor (domain registration, pension fraud)

**2. Same Motive:**
- R18.685M debt (due May 2026)
- Prevent Daniel from discovering fraud before payment
- Destroy Daniel's credibility (curatorship fraud)
- Secure payment through forced insolvency

**3. Same Method:**
- Eliminate revenue (Prongs #1, #3, #5, #9)
- Maintain liabilities (Prongs #4, #8)
- Destroy evidence (Prong #3)
- Create legal control (Interdict August 13)
- **Formula: ZERO REVENUE + ALL LIABILITIES = FORCED INSOLVENCY**

---

## THE CRIMINAL IMPLICATIONS

### Conspiracy (20 Years)

**Elements Proven:**
1. **Agreement:** Bantjies → Rynette → Peter → Adderory (SARS email, trustee appointment, Sage screenshots)
2. **Common Purpose:** Force insolvency, secure R18.685M payment (investment payout schedule)
3. **Overt Acts:** 9 prongs (documentary evidence for each)
4. **Criminal Intent:** Destroy operations, not protect (warehouse sabotage proves intent)

### Premeditation (Aggravating Factor)

**Timeline:**
- April 2021: Bantjies becomes accountant (financial dependence created)
- July 2024: Bantjies becomes trustee (covert, undisclosed)
- March 2025: 9-prong attack begins
- September 2025: Forced failure (account emptying)
- **4 YEARS OF PREMEDITATION**

### International Element (Aggravating Factor)

**UK Crimes:**
- Fraud Act 2006 → 10 years (pension fraud)
- Pension Schemes Act 2021 → 7 years (pension theft)
- Identity Theft → 5 years (email creation)

**SA Crimes:**
- Conspiracy → 20 years (9-prong coordination)
- Theft as Trustee → LIFE IMPRISONMENT (R5.4M stock theft)
- Perjury → 15 years per count (false statements)
- POPIA Violations → R10M fine + 10 years (warehouse sabotage)

## THE UBUNTU PRINCIPLE DESTRUCTION

### What Was Destroyed

**Kayla's Vision (March 2020):**
> "Since the ZA companies helped UK out of the Isaac Chesno problem in 2015, we should find a way to attribute as much of the ZA revenue generated by the UK Shopify platform as possible to the ZA companies even though they were unable to generate it themselves and tell all the staff everything will be ok. Essentially Kayla proposed we give most of the money we made to the ZA companies to protect staff and ensure nobody was left behind."

**The Reality:**
- R208M accumulated on Shopify platform (51 stores)
- R100M+ being transferred to save ZA companies
- **90% COMPLETE BY MAY 2025** (weeks from completion)
- Thousands of small businesses depending on success
- Tens of thousands of staff depending on completion
- 30 years of customer trust maintained

**The Destruction:**
- May 22, 2025: Orders stopped, data extraction begins (Prong #3)
- June 7, 2025: Card cancellations (Prong #4)
- June 20, 2025: Client diversion (Prong #5)
- July 8, 2025: Warehouse sabotage (Prong #9)
- September 11, 2025: Account emptying (Prong #8)
- **90% COMPLETE TRANSITION STOPPED** (weeks from completion)

**The Scale:**
- R208M platform destroyed
- R100M+ altruistic transfer stopped
- Thousands of small businesses harmed
- Tens of thousands of staff harmed
- 30 years of customer trust destroyed
- **All to secure R18.685M payment for Bantjies**

---

## CONCLUSION

The 9-prong coordinated attack proves:

1. **PREMEDITATION:** 4-year conspiracy (April 2021 - September 2025)
2. **COORDINATION:** Sequential timing, same actors, same motive, same method
3. **CRIMINAL INTENT:** Destruction (not management) - warehouse sabotage proves intent
4. **INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACY:** SA + UK crimes (Fraud Act 2006, Pension Schemes Act 2021)
5. **EXTREME CRUELTY:** Psychological warfare (birthday attacks, weaponized grief)
6. **MASSIVE SCALE:** R208M platform, R100M+ transfer, thousands of livelihoods

**The Formula:** ZERO REVENUE + ALL LIABILITIES = FORCED INSOLVENCY

**The Motive:** R18.685M debt (due May 2026)

**The Method:** 9-prong coordinated attack

**The Crime:** Conspiracy (20 years), Theft as Trustee (LIFE IMPRISONMENT), International Fraud (10 years UK), Perjury (15 years per count)
