# THE REAL POWER STRUCTURE
## Three-Level Hierarchy of Control

**Case 2025-137857: Peter Andrew Faucitt v. Jacqueline Faucitt & Daniel James Faucitt**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Peter Faucitt is **NOT** the ultimate controller of the RegimA Group or the Faucitt Family Trust. He is a **figurehead puppet** controlled by **Danie Bantjies** (Trustee and Accountant) through **Rynette Farrar** (Administrator).

This three-level power structure explains why Peter's actions appear irrational, contradictory, and self-destructive—**because Peter is not making the decisions**.

---

## THE THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY

### LEVEL 1: DANIE BANTJIES (Ultimate Controller)

**Position:** Trustee (Faucitt Family Trust)  
**Appointment Date:** July 2024 (covert, undisclosed to beneficiaries)  
**Additional Roles:**
- Accountant (RegimA companies - creates financial dependence)
- Commissioner of Oaths (dual role - witness + certifier)
- **R18.685M Creditor** (first payment due May 2026)

#### Evidence of Ultimate Control

**1. SARS Audit Email (Smoking Gun #5)**
- SARS was auditing and asking about huge amounts
- Rynette said: **"BANTJIES INSTRUCTED HER TO MAKE THOSE HUGE PAYMENTS"**
- This proves Bantjies gives financial instructions (not Peter)

**2. Trustee Appointment Email (August 11, 2025)**
- Rynette sends trustee appointment document **TO BANTJIES**
- This proves Bantjies controls trust administration (not Peter)

**3. R18.685M Creditor Status**
- First payment due May 2026
- Creates **MASSIVE FINANCIAL LEVERAGE** over Peter and trust
- Motive: Prevent Daniel from discovering fraud before payment secured

**4. Commissioner of Oaths Dual Role**
- Bantjies is both witness AND certifier of Peter's affidavit
- Creates conflict of interest and control over legal narrative

**5. 2-Year Accounting Blackout**
- July 2023 - March 2025: NO BOOKS despite Linda employed "just to do those books"
- March 30, 2025: Dump 2 years unallocated expenses (12-hour deadline)
- Only Bantjies (as accountant) could orchestrate this systematic obstruction

**6. June 6, 2025 Meeting**
- Daniel presents fraud findings to Bantjies
- June 7, 2025: Card cancellations (next day retaliation)
- This proves Bantjies controls operational decisions (not Peter)

---

### LEVEL 2: RYNETTE FARRAR (Executor)

**Position:** Administrator (RegimA Group)  
**Role:** Executes Bantjies' instructions, controls all operational systems

#### Evidence of Executor Control

**1. Email Control (Sage Screenshot - June 20, 2025)**
- Rynette controls **pete@regima.com** (Peter's email address)
- Peter has NO ACCESS to his own email
- All communications "from Peter" are actually from Rynette

**2. Accounting System Control (Sage Screenshot - August 25, 2025)**
- Rynette is **subscription owner** of Sage accounting system
- Controls ALL ACCESS to financial records
- Can add/remove users, manipulate data, hide transactions

**3. Bank Account Control**
- Rynette controls all company bank accounts
- September 11, 2025: Rynette transfers R1.73M from Villa Via
- Peter has NO INDEPENDENT ACCESS to bank accounts

**4. Takes Instructions from Bantjies (Not Peter)**
- SARS Audit Email: "Bantjies instructed huge payments"
- Trustee Appointment: Sends document TO BANTJIES (not Peter)
- June 7 Card Cancellations: Day after Daniel's meeting with Bantjies

**5. Phone Number Appropriation**
- 011 615 29869 was Kayla's business number (2017)
- Now used by Rynette (after Kayla's murder July 2023)
- Proves identity appropriation and continuity of control

**6. Court Order Interference**
- 2023: Court order obtained to seize account from Kayla's email
- Interfered with law enforcement investigation (instructed "TOUCH NOTHING")
- Only Rynette (as administrator) could execute this

---

### LEVEL 3: PETER FAUCITT (Figurehead)

**Position:** Nominal applicant, puppet with no independent control  
**Reality:** NO ACCESS to accounts, banks, email, or operational systems

#### Evidence of Figurehead Status

**1. NO ACCESS to Email**
- Sage Screenshot (June 20, 2025): Rynette controls pete@regima.com
- Peter cannot send/receive emails independently
- All "Peter's emails" are actually Rynette's

**2. NO ACCESS to Accounting System**
- Sage Screenshot (August 25, 2025): Rynette is subscription owner
- Peter cannot view financial records independently
- Must rely on Rynette for all financial information

**3. NO ACCESS to Bank Accounts**
- September 11, 2025: Rynette transfers R1.73M (not Peter)
- Peter cannot execute transactions independently
- Must rely on Rynette for all banking

**4. R18.685M Debt to Bantjies**
- First payment due May 2026
- Creates **MASSIVE FINANCIAL LEVERAGE**
- Peter is financially dependent on Bantjies

**5. Contradictory Actions**
- June 6: Requests reports → June 7: Cancels cards (makes reports inaccessible)
- Claims "urgency" → 67-day delay before filing
- Claims "financial oversight" → Sabotages R34.9M operations (July 8 warehouse)
- These contradictions prove Peter is NOT making decisions

**6. Irrational Behavior**
- Why bypass absolute trust powers to seek court interdict?
- Why sabotage own companies (co-director of RegimA SA)?
- Why destroy R100M+ altruistic transfer (Ubuntu Principle)?
- Answer: **Peter is following Bantjies' instructions (not acting rationally)**

## THE CONTROL MECHANISM

### How Bantjies Controls Peter Through Rynette

```
BANTJIES (Ultimate Controller)
    ↓ (Instructions)
RYNETTE (Executor)
    ↓ (Controls email, accounts, banks)
PETER (Figurehead)
    ↓ (Signs documents, appears in court)
PUBLIC/COURT (Deceived)
```

**The Deception:**
1. Bantjies gives instructions to Rynette
2. Rynette executes using Peter's email (pete@regima.com)
3. Peter signs documents prepared by Bantjies/Rynette
4. Public/Court believes Peter is acting independently
5. **Reality: Peter is puppet with no independent control**

---

## THE SMOKING GUN PROOF

### SARS Audit Email (Most Explosive)

**Context:** SARS was auditing and asking about huge amounts  
**Rynette's Statement:** **"BANTJIES INSTRUCTED HER TO MAKE THOSE HUGE PAYMENTS"**

**This single sentence proves:**
1. Bantjies gives financial instructions (not Peter)
2. Rynette takes orders from Bantjies (not Peter)
3. Peter is NOT the ultimate controller
4. The entire interdict application is based on FALSE PREMISE

---

## THE MOTIVE: R18.685M DEBT

### Why Bantjies Orchestrated This Conspiracy

**Bantjies' Position:**
- R18.685M creditor (first payment due May 2026)
- Trustee (July 2024 - covert appointment)
- Accountant (financial dependence)

**The Problem:**
- June 6, 2025: Daniel presents fraud findings to Bantjies
- Daniel discovered fraud hidden in accounts
- Daniel is competent investigator (68-day investigation)
- **Risk: Daniel will discover MORE fraud before May 2026 payment**

**The Solution:**
- Remove Daniel from all operational control
- Destroy Daniel's credibility (curatorship fraud attempt)
- Secure R18.685M payment before fraud fully exposed
- Use Peter as figurehead to avoid suspicion

**The Timeline:**
- June 6, 2025: Daniel exposes fraud to Bantjies
- June 7, 2025: Card cancellations (retaliation begins)
- July 8, 2025: Warehouse sabotage (operations destroyed)
- August 13, 2025: Interdict granted (legal control secured)
- September 11, 2025: Accounts emptied (forced failure)
- **May 2026: R18.685M payment due (MOTIVE)**

---

## THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

### For the Court

**The interdict application is based on FALSE PREMISE:**
- Peter claims to be protecting companies
- **Reality: Peter is puppet controlled by Bantjies**
- Bantjies orchestrated destruction (not protection)
- Court was deceived about true power structure

### For Criminal Prosecution

**Bantjies is the PRIMARY PERPETRATOR:**
1. **Theft as Trustee** → LIFE IMPRISONMENT (R5.4M stock theft)
2. **Perjury** → 10 years (material omissions in affidavit)
3. **Fraud** → 15 years (systematic deception)
4. **Conspiracy** → 20 years (4-year international conspiracy)

**Rynette is the EXECUTOR:**
1. **Fraud** → 15 years (email control, identity appropriation)
2. **POPIA Violations** → R10M fine + 10 years (unauthorized access)
3. **UK Pension Fraud** → 10 years (Fraud Act 2006)

**Peter is the FIGUREHEAD:**
1. **Perjury** → 15 years (false statements under oath)
2. **POPIA Violations** → R10M fine + 10 years (warehouse sabotage)
3. **Conspiracy** → 20 years (knowing participation)
