## IMPACT ON ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

### Add Comprehensive Section on May 15 Confrontation

**Suggested Paragraph Structure:**

**PARA Z: FIRST RESPONDENT ACTIVELY INVESTIGATED FRAUD AS TRUSTEE**

Z.1 **The May 15 Confrontation:** On May 15, 2025, the First Respondent (Jacqui Faucitt), in her capacity as Trustee, confronted Ms Rynette Farrar about R1,035,000 owed to Rezonance by RegimA Skin Treatments since February 2023. Ms Farrar claimed the debt was paid. The First Respondent explained that these funds were part of Kayla's estate (Kayla was murdered in August 2023) and keeping them would be "profiting from the proceeds of murder."

Z.2 **Trustee Fulfilling Fiduciary Duty:** The First Respondent was ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING FRAUD as a Trustee. She was FULFILLING HER FIDUCIARY DUTY to protect beneficiary interests (Kayla's estate, my rights as beneficiary). This was not family support. This was a Trustee doing her job.

Z.3 **Immediate Retaliation (May 22):** One week later (May 22, 2025), orders were taken off Shopify. This was IMMEDIATE RETALIATION against the First Respondent for investigating fraud. This sabotaged business operations and obstructed evidence (order history removed).

Z.4 **Theft of Business (May 29):** One week later (May 29, 2025), the domain regimaskin.co.za was registered by Adderory (Ms Farrar's son's company). This was THEFT OF BUSINESS in retaliation for the First Respondent's investigation. The domain was previously operated by my companies (RegimA SA, RegimA Zone) and was now diverted to Ms Farrar's son's company.

Z.5 **Family Conspiracy:** This proves Ms Farrar's son (Adderory) actively participated in the conspiracy. This is not just Peter, Danie, and Rynette. This is a FAMILY CONSPIRACY involving Rynette's son.

Z.6 **Profiting from Proceeds of Murder:** The First Respondent's statement was accurate. The R1,035,000 owed to Rezonance is part of Kayla's estate. Keeping these funds is "profiting from the proceeds of murder" under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Ms Farrar falsely claimed the debt was paid. The debt remains unpaid.

Z.7 **Timeline Proves Retaliation:**
- May 15: First Respondent investigates fraud
- May 22: Orders removed (7 days later) - RETALIATION
- May 29: Domain stolen (14 days later) - RETALIATION
- June 7: Cards cancelled - OBSTRUCTION
- Aug 11: First Respondent deceived - DECEPTION
- Aug 13: First Respondent included in interdict - FINAL PUNISHMENT

Z.8 **Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice:** This timeline proves the Applicant, Mr Bantjies, Ms Farrar, and Adderory conspired to:
- Retaliate against the First Respondent for investigating fraud (May 22, 29)
- Obstruct documentation (June 7)
- Deceive the First Respondent (Aug 11)
- Silence the First Respondent (Aug 13)
- Obstruct justice by preventing fraud investigation

Z.9 **Evidence Required:** I attach hereto marked "JF-MAY15-1" evidence of the First Respondent's May 15, 2025 confrontation with Ms Farrar, marked "JF-MAY15-2" evidence of orders being removed from Shopify on May 22, 2025, and marked "JF-MAY15-3" WHOIS records showing regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory on May 29, 2025.
