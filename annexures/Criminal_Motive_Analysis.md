# Analysis of Financial Motive

## Introduction

This document provides an analysis of the financial relationship between Danie Bantjies and the Faucitt Family Trust, and how this relationship may have influenced the events in Case 2025-137857. A key piece of evidence is an investment payout schedule that indicates Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, not a creditor.

## The Investment Payout Schedule

**Evidence:** An investment payout schedule shows a debt of R18,685,000.

**Interpretation:**
*   **Debtor:** Danie Bantjies
*   **Creditors:** Peter Faucitt, Jacqueline Faucitt, Faucitt Family Trust
*   **Amount Owed:** R18,685,000
*   **First Payment Due:** May 2026

This interpretation suggests that Mr. Bantjies has a significant financial obligation to the trust, which may provide a motive for his actions.

## Analysis of Potential Motive

The allegation is that Mr. Bantjies, as a debtor, had a motive to undermine the financial stability of the companies in order to avoid his R18.685M payment obligation. This theory is supported by the following timeline of events:

*   **July 2024:** Mr. Bantjies is appointed as a trustee.
*   **March 2025:** Alleged revenue diversion begins.
*   **May 2026:** First payment from Mr. Bantjies is due.

This timeline suggests a potential strategy to create a situation of insolvency before the debt became due.

### Alleged Strategy for Debt Elimination

1.  **Gain Control:** Become a trustee to gain control over the trust and its assets.
2.  **Disrupt Revenue:** Divert revenue streams to create financial distress.
3.  **Transfer Funds:** Transfer funds from company accounts to personal accounts.
4.  **Force Insolvency:** Create a situation where the companies are unable to pay their debts.
5.  **Avoid Payment:** Claim that the companies are insolvent and there are no assets to collect from.

## Comparison of Creditor vs. Debtor Motive

### If Mr. Bantjies Were a Creditor:

*   **Expected Behavior:** To want the companies to succeed in order to be repaid.
*   **Actual Behavior:** The evidence suggests that Mr. Bantjies' actions were detrimental to the companies' financial health.

### If Mr. Bantjies Is a Debtor:

*   **Expected Behavior:** To want the companies to fail in order to avoid payment.
*   **Actual Behavior:** The evidence of revenue diversion, funds transfer, and other actions is consistent with this motive.

**Conclusion:** The theory that Mr. Bantjies acted as a debtor seeking to avoid payment provides a more consistent explanation for the events that transpired.

## Legal Implications

The allegation that Mr. Bantjies acted to eliminate his personal debt has serious legal implications, including:

*   **Theft:** The transfer of R16.08M from company accounts could be considered theft.
*   **Fraud:** The entire series of events could be seen as a fraudulent scheme to eliminate a debt.
*   **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** As a trustee, Mr. Bantjies had a duty to act in the best interests of the trust and its beneficiaries.
*   **Perjury:** Any false statements made under oath to conceal this motive would constitute perjury.

## Conclusion

The interpretation of Danie Bantjies as a debtor provides a strong potential motive for the actions taken to undermine the financial stability of the companies. This theory is supported by the timeline of events and the specific actions taken. The legal implications of this alleged scheme are significant and should be fully investigated.
