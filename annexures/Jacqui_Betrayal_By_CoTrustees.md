## Analysis of the "Main Trustee" Document

On August 11, 2025, Jacqueline Faucitt signed a document that designated Peter Faucitt as the "Main Trustee" of the Faucitt Family Trust. This document was backdated to July 1, 2025. The legal implications of this backdating should be examined.

Two days later, on August 13, 2025, Peter Faucitt filed a founding affidavit for an interdict, naming Jacqueline Faucitt as the First Respondent. The reason given for her inclusion was for "helping Daniel."

This sequence of events raises questions about the good faith of the parties involved and whether Jacqueline Faucitt was fully informed of the intended use of the document she signed.

### Rynette Farrar's Role

On August 11, 2025, Rynette Farrar sent the signed and backdated document to Danie Bantjies. This action suggests her involvement in the process of creating and disseminating the document.

## Legal Implications

### 1. Validity of the "Main Trustee" Document

The backdating of the document to July 1, 2025, raises questions about its validity and whether it constitutes a misrepresentation of the facts.

### 2. Breach of Fiduciary Duty

As co-trustees, Peter Faucitt and Danie Bantjies had a fiduciary duty to act in good faith towards Jacqueline Faucitt. The act of having her sign a document that would be used against her in a legal proceeding two days later could be construed as a breach of this duty.

### 3. Abuse of Trust Powers

The use of trust powers to punish a trustee for fulfilling their fiduciary duty to a beneficiary is a serious allegation that warrants investigation.

## Conclusion

The timeline of events surrounding the signing of the "Main Trustee" document and the subsequent inclusion of Jacqueline Faucitt in the interdict application suggests a coordinated effort to remove her from a position of authority and to punish her for her support of Daniel Faucitt. The backdating of the document, the short time frame between its signing and the legal action, and the involvement of multiple parties all point to a pre-meditated plan. This evidence should be presented to the court to demonstrate that Jacqueline Faucitt is a victim in this matter, not a perpetrator, and that the actions taken against her were an abuse of trust powers.
