## Section 1: Applicant's Personal Details and Parties (AD 1-3.13)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 1** - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty | Peter invokes director liability provisions. The affidavit will reveal that the accounting system used to track these alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using Peter's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025. Peter himself had no access to this system. |
| **AD 1.3** - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration | Peter provides his ID (520430 5708 18 5) and address. The affidavit is commissioned by Danie Bantjies, identified as "our accountant." Bantjies's full role will progressively emerge through the document. |
| **AD 2** - Company Business Conduct Requirements | Peter alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The actual financial performance shows Dan and Kayla built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA: 25 stores, R8.5M turnover. RegimA Zone: 26 stores, R26.4M turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under Dan's management. |
| **AD 2.4** - Parties to the Application - Introduction | Peter introduces the parties. The corporate structure will reveal that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013), which has three trustees. Two are identified in this affidavit: Peter and Jax. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries. |
| **AD 3** - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members | Peter seeks probation orders. The Companies Act Section 162 requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will show that the accountant who "discovered" the alleged irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles. |
| **AD 3.2** - Respondents - Wife | Jax is identified as Peter's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, Jax confronted Rynette Farrar about a R1,035,000 debt owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance since February 2023. These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. Jax stated that keeping them would be "profiting from the proceeds of murder." This confrontation will prove significant. |
| **AD 3.4** - Respondents - Son | Dan is identified as Peter's son and Second Respondent. On 6 June 2025, Dan cooperated with Peter's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Dan unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators. |
| **AD 3.4.2** - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments | RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Kayla's estate) since February 2023. When Jax raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Rynette claimed it was paid—a false statement. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Rynette's son. |
| **AD 3.6** - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK | RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions show continuous Shopify payments. This contradicts claims that will appear later in the affidavit about UK entities owing money to SA operations. |
| **AD 3.6.1** - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC | Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis shows an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group—an excessive profit extraction. This was the fraud Dan reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025. |
| **AD 3.6.2** - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia | Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application. |
| **AD 3.7** - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC | Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024—stock that "just disappeared." This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments. |
| **AD 3.7.2** - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics | Property registration documents. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Rynette claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the huge payments related to this transaction. |
| **AD 3.8** - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB) | FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without Dan's authority as co-director. The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade. |
| **AD 3.9** - Eighth and Ninth Respondents | ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Rynette may have opened 8 ABSA accounts using Dan's information without authorization. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025. |
| **AD 3.11** - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son | Peter refers to Jax and Dan as "my wife" and "my son." Both are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. Jax is also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries. |
| **AD 3.13** - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation | Jurisdiction confirmed. The affidavit is commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signs as "Commissioner of Oaths." Bantjies's accounting firm is "Bantjes and Company." His full relationship to the trust and companies will emerge through the evidence. |

## Section 2: Accountant Details - Bantjies Conflict of Interest (AD 4)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 4** - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company | Peter identifies "our accountant" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of "Bantjes and Company," who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What Peter does not disclose: (1) Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust—a status unknown to beneficiaries Dan and Jax; (2) Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule (May 2026, 2027, 2029); (3) Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Rynette for multi-million rand transactions; (4) Bantjies was "running the companies" when Dan exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025; (5) Bantjies dismissed Dan's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was "going on holiday." This creates an impermissible conflict: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud Dan reported. |

---

## Section 3: Corporate Structure (AD 6.1-6.5)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 6.1** - Relationships Between Parties | Peter describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence shows a different control structure: Rynette controlled all bank accounts (Peter had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using Peter's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions rather than Peter's. Rynette's sister Linda was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025. |
| **AD 6.3** - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities | Peter describes directorships. Key facts: Jax and Dan are co-directors of RegimA SA and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD). RWD is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Rynette and Peter dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RWD and demanded Dan sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts. Dan used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud. |
| **AD 6.5** - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities | Peter describes banking arrangements. The evidence shows: (1) Peter had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Rynette controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RWD started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts—six months after sabotage began, Dan was still managing to pay creditors. |

---

## Section 4: Urgency and Alleged Misconduct (AD 7-7.20)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 7** - Urgency and Delay Considerations | Peter claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to Dan's fraud exposure on 6 June and Jax's debt inquiry on 15 May. |
| **AD 7.3** - Urgency Details | Peter claims the accountant noted "numerous discrepancies" and "irregular payments" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis: 6 June 2025 (Dan provides comprehensive reports to Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Peter cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after Dan's cooperation, not "following" any discovery. This is venire contra factum proprium—Peter created the problem he now complains about. |
| **AD 7.6** - Financial Impact of Misconduct | Peter alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after Jax's confrontation); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after Jax's confrontation); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed). |
| **AD 7.8** - Continuing Harm to Corporations | Peter claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted: Email from Gee on 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send "don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za" email. Regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Rynette's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from Dan's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Rynette's family. |
| **AD 7.10** - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions | Peter claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 "following" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from Dan. Timeline evidence: (1) 6 June: Dan provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Peter cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions; (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then Peter complained about missing documentation. |
| **AD 7.13** - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations | Peter claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, Dan substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and Jax her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone. Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers. |
| **AD 7.16** - Son's Interference with Business Operations | Peter alleges Dan interfered with operations. The evidence shows Dan built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. Dan's partner Kayla Pretorius co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account. |
| **AD 7.18** - Email and Account Access Interference | Peter claims Dan restricted email access. The evidence shows: (1) Peter had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)—controlled by Rynette; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Rynette using Peter's email; (3) Rynette claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder. |
| **AD 7.20** - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests | Peter claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by Dan's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either Jax's debt inquiry (15 May) or Dan's fraud exposure (6 June). |

## Section 5: Financial Discrepancies and Misconduct (AD 8.4-9.3)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 8.4** - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies | Peter claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant is Danie Bantjies, who is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of Dan's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Bantjies dismissed Dan's audit request on 10 June 2025. The "discovery" occurred after Dan exposed fraud to the person running the fraud. |
| **AD 8.5** - Accountant's Attendance and Findings | Peter states Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RWD on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Rynette controlled the accounting system using Peter's email; (2) Linda (Rynette's sister) was employed as bookkeeper; (3) Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties? |
| **AD 8.7** - IT Expenses and Tax Problems | Peter cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. Peter claims these are "almost entirely unexplainable." Context omitted from the affidavit: These expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)—reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. Peter fails to disclose the revenue context. |
| **AD 8.10** - International Expenses and Tax Implications | Peter claims expenses are "seemingly international" and accounts have "almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa." The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions show continuous Shopify payments. The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations. |
| **AD 9.2** - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers | Peter references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually, as evidenced by Shopify invoices. The payment direction is UK → SA, not SA → UK as Peter's affidavit implies. |
| **AD 9.3** - Financial Misconduct Summary | Peter summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without Dan's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics—same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments; (3) Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the huge payments for this stock (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Rynette's false claim to Jax that it was paid. |

## Section 6: Application to Declare Respondents Delinquent (AD 10.1-10.14)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 10.1** - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation | Peter seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for Peter's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after Dan's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows (perjury); (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures. |
| **AD 10.3** - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents | Peter alleges delinquent conduct by Jax and Dan. Jax's actual conduct: (1) Fulfilled fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronted Rynette about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Deceived by co-trustees into signing "Main Trustee" document (11 Aug 2025); (4) Punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025). Dan's actual conduct: (1) Built R34.9M profitable operations; (2) Reported Villa Via fraud to accountant (6 June 2025); (3) Cooperated by providing comprehensive reports; (4) Substituted personal card to prevent business collapse after Peter's sabotage. |
| **AD 10.4** - Contravention of Companies Act | Peter alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. Peter's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses. |
| **AD 10.5.2** - Probation Relief Under Section 162 | Peter seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud Dan reported. |
| **AD 10.6** - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties | Peter invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that "disappeared"—same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests. |
| **AD 10.6.1** - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest | Peter cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales—10 times the historical adjustment. Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest. |
| **AD 10.6.2** - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers | Peter cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without Dan's authority as co-director. Peter exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally. |
| **AD 10.6.3** - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest | Peter cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Rynette's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Rynette's son) competing with RegimA operations. |
| **AD 10.7** - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty | Peter invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) Peter breached fiduciary duty to Dan (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Peter breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud. |
| **AD 10.7.1.2** - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived | Peter cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory). |
| **AD 10.7.1.4** - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation | Peter cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock "disappeared"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies. |
| **AD 10.8** - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47 | Peter invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud. |
| **AD 10.8.1** - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief | Peter seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring Peter delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements). |
| **AD 10.9** - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5) | Peter invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to Peter's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries). |
| **AD 10.9.2** - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm | Peter alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by Peter and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Dan cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after Jax's inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after Jax's inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either Jax's debt inquiry or Dan's fraud exposure. |
| **AD 10.9.3** - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct | Peter alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith. |
| **AD 10.9.3.1** - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct | Peter alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after Jax investigated fraud and Dan exposed fraud. |
| **AD 10.9.3.2** - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts | Peter alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Rynette controlled systems using Peter's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" with Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction. |
| **AD 10.9.3.3** - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose | Peter alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose: (1) Peter omitted Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Peter omitted Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Peter omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Peter omitted UK → SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Peter omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Dan's cooperation; (6) Peter omitted Jax's debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation. |
| **AD 10.10** - Probation Under Section 162(7) | Peter seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct: (1) Jax fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Dan exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses they built. |
| **AD 10.10.2.3** - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers | Peter alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers: (1) Peter used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Peter used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Peter used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures. |
| **AD 10.10.2.4** - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result | Peter alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results: (1) Jax excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Dan excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Rynette's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock "disappeared"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid. |
| **AD 10.10.22** - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner | Peter alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct: (1) Rynette controlled all systems using Peter's email while claiming to act under Bantjies's instructions; (2) Peter had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation. |
| **AD 10.10.41** - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties | Peter alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Peter, Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Peter); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Rynette). |
| **AD 10.13** - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums | Peter alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025. |
| **AD 10.14** - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined | Peter claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Rynette's control of Peter's email; (4) Rynette's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation; (8) Possible 8 ABSA accounts opened using Dan's information. |

## Section 7: UK Operations and Alleged Fraud (AD 11.2-12.4)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 11.2** - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd | Peter describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions show continuous Shopify payments. The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations. |
| **AD 11.3** - Directors of UK Entity | Peter describes UK directors. The UK company was established by Dan and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), Dan continued managing the operations. |
| **AD 11.4** - Applicant's Role in Operations | Peter describes his role. The evidence shows Peter had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Rynette); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Rynette); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Rynette); (4) Rynette claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's. Peter appears to be a figurehead. |
| **AD 11.6** - UK Branch Operations | Peter describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices show UK → SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually. The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse. |
| **AD 11.8** - UK Financial Concerns | Peter expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail. |
| **AD 12.1** - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns | Peter alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices (DF5-DF7) prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually. UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices. Peter's statement is demonstrably false—perjury. |
| **AD 12.2** - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk | Peter alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, Dan was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied. |
| **AD 12.3** - Purpose of Court Application | Peter states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose: (1) Punish Jax for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Dan for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Dan built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud. |
| **AD 12.4** - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son | Peter suggests alternative roles for Jax and Dan. The evidence shows: (1) Jax fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Dan built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees Peter and Bantjies; (5) Jax was included in interdict two days after signing "Main Trustee" document. |

## Section 8: Requirements for Interdictory Relief (AD 13.2-13.8)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 13.2** - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced | Peter claims clear right not to be prejudiced. Peter has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Dan's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with "additional powers"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow perjury). |
| **AD 13.2.2** - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm | Peter claims injury and apprehension of harm. Peter suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief. |
| **AD 13.3** - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm | Peter claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by Peter's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. Dan and Jax suffered irreparable harm, not Peter. |
| **AD 13.4** - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival | Peter claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under Dan's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from Peter's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding Dan and Jax threatened survival, not ensured it. |
| **AD 13.5** - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief | Peter claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors Dan and Jax: (1) They built and managed profitable operations; (2) They investigated and exposed fraud; (3) They were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) They substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) They support independent forensic audit. Peter obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements. |
| **AD 13.8** - Other Relief Sought in Part A | Peter seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting Jax's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern. |

## Section 9: Financial Constraints and Forensic Audit (AD 14.1-14.5)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 14.1** - Financial Constraints on Respondents | Peter seeks financial constraints on Jax and Dan. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, Dan was still managing to pay creditors. |
| **AD 14.3** - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice | Peter seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by Peter: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage. |
| **AD 14.4** - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration | Peter seeks forensic audit. Dan and Jax support independent forensic audit by impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (SLG → Adderory → RST); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Rynette's control of systems using Peter's email. |
| **AD 14.5** - Request for Relief Under Part B | Peter requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock "disappearance"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Rynette's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Peter's delinquency under Section 162(5). |

## Section 10: Discovery and Urgency (AD 16.1-16.12)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 16.1** - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct | Peter claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery: (1) 15 May: Jax discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Dan exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Peter cancelled cards (day after Dan's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Bantjies dismissed audit request. Peter's "discovery" was actually consciousness of guilt after Dan exposed fraud to Bantjies. |
| **AD 16.2** - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action | Peter cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers: (1) 15 May: Jax confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 debt and "profiting from proceeds of murder"; (2) 6 June: Dan exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext. |
| **AD 16.5** - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process | Peter claims unawareness of urgent process. Peter had access to legal advice and Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency: preventing forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud. |
| **AD 16.6** - Delay Would Have Been Avoided | Peter claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Dan's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing Jax's punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing "Main Trustee" document 11 Aug). |
| **AD 16.8** - State of Shock and Delayed Response | Peter claims state of shock. Peter was not in shock—he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock—this is systematic execution. |
| **AD 16.10** - Attorney Consultation Timeline | Peter describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) Jax's debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Dan's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery. |
| **AD 16.12** - Need for Urgent Court Assistance | Peter claims need for urgent assistance. Peter had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with "additional powers" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee Jax (instead, he attacked her); (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). Peter chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage. |

---

## Section 11: Ex Parte Basis (AD 17.3-17.4)

| AD Paragraph | Commentary |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **AD 17.3** - Ex Parte Basis for Application | Peter justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow perjury (claimed SA → UK, actually UK → SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) Jax's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Dan's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Rynette's control of Peter's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock "disappearance." |
| **AD 17.4** - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief | Peter claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) Jax included two days after signing document shows coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent Dan and Jax from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud. |

## Section 12: Remaining Paragraphs (AD 18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)

The unauthorized transfers were made by Peter: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without Dan's authority as co-director.

## Narrative Summary

The AD paragraphs, when examined with the evidence, reveal a progressive pattern:

**Initial Layer:** Peter presents himself as a concerned director discovering financial irregularities through his accountant, Danie Bantjies.

**Second Layer:** The evidence shows Peter had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems—all controlled by Rynette Farrar, who claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's.

**Third Layer:** Bantjies is revealed to be an undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, unknown to beneficiaries Dan and Jax. Bantjies is also a debtor owing R18.685 million to the trust.

**Fourth Layer:** The timeline shows Dan exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies on 6 June 2025, and Peter cancelled business cards on 7 June 2025—one day later. Jax confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 debt on 15 May 2025, and data was expunged 7 days later, with a competing domain registered 14 days later.

**Fifth Layer:** The competing domain (regimaskin.co.za) is owned by Adderory, a company owned by Rynette's son. Adderory supplies stock to RegimA Skin Treatments—the same stock type that "disappeared" (R5.4M) from Strategic Logistics. Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the payments.

**Sixth Layer:** The R1,035,000 debt is owed to Rezonance, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. Kayla was Dan's partner and co-builder of the R34.9M Shopify operations. Kayla was murdered on 13 July 2023. A court order was obtained to seize her email account, interfering with a law enforcement investigation.

**Seventh Layer:** Jax was deceived into signing a "Main Trustee" document on 11 August 2025, backdating Peter's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, Peter and Bantjies (co-trustees) included Jax in the interdict—punishment for investigating the debt and supporting Dan.

**Final Layer:** The systematic sabotage campaign (Feb-Sep 2025) destroyed R34.9M operations that Dan built. Despite six months of sabotage, Dan was still managing to pay creditors until accounts were emptied on 11 September 2025. The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures to prevent forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.

**The Web Revealed:** Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Commissioner of Oaths) had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery. Rynette (Administrator controlling all systems) claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions. Rynette's son (Adderory) benefited from stock transfer pricing and domain theft. Peter (Figurehead with no access) attacked beneficiaries after they investigated fraud. The court process was abused to prevent exposure of this tangled web of conflicts, self-dealing, and systematic fraud.
