# Improvement Recommendations for Answering Affidavits

**Case:** 2025-137857: Peter Andrew Faucitt v. Jacqueline Faucitt & Daniel James Faucitt

**Date:** November 1, 2025

**Objective:** To provide actionable recommendations for enhancing the clarity, legal strength, and narrative coherence of the answering affidavits of Jacqueline Faucitt and Daniel James Faucitt.

---

## 1. Overall Narrative and Strategy

### 1.1. **Centralize the Retaliation Narrative**

The core of the defense rests on the argument that the Applicant's legal action is a direct and calculated retaliation for the Respondents' efforts to expose financial misconduct. This narrative should be the central thread connecting all sections of the affidavits.

**Recommendation:**

-   Begin each major section with a concise statement that frames the subsequent facts as part of this retaliatory pattern. For example: "The Applicant's allegations regarding financial misconduct must be viewed in the context of his actions immediately following my report of fraud to his accountant on 6 June 2025."
-   Create a master timeline of events as a standalone annexure, and refer to it consistently throughout the affidavits. This will provide a clear, chronological overview of the Applicant's escalating sabotage.

### 1.2. **Emphasize the "Manufactured Crisis"**

The Applicant's claim of urgency is demonstrably false. The evidence strongly suggests that the crisis was intentionally manufactured to create a pretext for the ex parte application.

**Recommendation:**

-   Explicitly use the term "manufactured crisis" to describe the situation created by the Applicant's cancellation of the business credit cards.
-   Legally frame this as a breach of the principle of *venire contra factum proprium* (no one may act against their own previous conduct). The Applicant cannot complain of a situation he himself created.

## 2. Financial Arguments

### 2.1. **Simplify Complex Financial Schemes**

The affidavits detail several complex financial schemes (e.g., the R5.4M stock adjustment, the Villa Via profit extraction). These need to be presented in a way that is easily understandable to a non-accountant.

**Recommendation:**

-   Use diagrams to visually represent the flow of funds and goods in the R5.4M stock adjustment scheme (Strategic Logistics -> Adderory -> RegimA Skin Treatments).
-   Create a simple table that contrasts the rent charged by Villa Via with market rates to starkly illustrate the 86% profit margin.
-   For the UK-SA payment flows, use a simplified ledger format to show that the UK entity was a net funder of the SA operations, directly contradicting the Applicant's claims.

### 2.2. **Quantify the Sabotage**

The financial impact of the Applicant's sabotage is a critical element of the defense. This impact should be quantified wherever possible.

**Recommendation:**

-   Create a summary table that quantifies the financial losses resulting from the Applicant's actions (e.g., lost revenue from the 51 Shopify stores, the cost of the R5.4M stock write-off, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers).
-   Where exact figures are not available, provide reasoned estimates based on historical data (e.g., projecting lost revenue based on the R34.9M annual turnover).

## 3. Legal Arguments

### 3.1. **Strengthen the Conflict of Interest Argument**

The multiple, undisclosed conflicts of interest involving Danie Bantjies are a cornerstone of the defense. This argument can be further strengthened.

**Recommendation:**

-   Dedicate a separate section of the affidavits to a detailed analysis of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts, citing the relevant provisions of the Trust Property Control Act and the Companies Act.
-   Argue that Mr. Bantjies's involvement as Commissioner of Oaths for the founding affidavit, given his undisclosed conflicts, renders the affidavit fatally flawed.
-   Research and cite case law on the duties of trustees and the consequences of conflicts of interest.

### 3.2. **Frame the Counter-Application for Delinquency**

The prayer for a counter-application to declare the Applicant delinquent is a powerful move. This should be framed as a necessary step to protect the companies from further harm.

**Recommendation:**

-   Structure the argument for the Applicant's delinquency around the specific grounds listed in Section 162(5) of the Companies Act (gross abuse of position, intentional harm, etc.).
-   For each ground, provide a bulleted list of the Applicant's actions that satisfy the legal test.

## 4. Structural and Formatting Recommendations

### 4.1. **Use of Headings and Subheadings**

The refined affidavits make good use of headings. This can be further improved to enhance readability.

**Recommendation:**

-   Use a consistent, hierarchical heading structure throughout the documents.
-   Keep headings concise and descriptive.

### 4.2. **Annexures**

The annexures are critical to substantiating the Respondents' claims. They should be presented in a clear and organized manner.

**Recommendation:**

-   Create a comprehensive, hyperlinked list of annexures at the beginning of each affidavit.
-   Ensure that all references to annexures in the body of the affidavits are hyperlinked to the corresponding document.
-   For key annexures (e.g., the timeline, the financial diagrams), consider embedding them directly into the body of the affidavit for maximum impact.
