## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

---

I, the undersigned,

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. I am an adult female, the First Respondent in this matter, residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. The facts herein are within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated or apparent from the context, and are true and correct.
1.2. I have read the Answering Affidavit of the Second Respondent, Daniel James Faucitt, and I confirm the contents thereof as true and correct in so far as they relate to me. I align myself with the submissions made by the Second Respondent and will not repeat them, save where necessary to provide my own perspective.
1.3. This application is an abuse of process. The Applicant has fabricated a crisis to punish me for fulfilling my fiduciary duties as a trustee and for supporting the Second Respondent.

---

### AD PARAGRAPHS 1 & 1.3: APPLICANT'S PERSONAL DETAILS AND DECLARATION

2.1. I admit the Applicant’s identity and address. I deny the remainder of the allegations in these paragraphs.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 2 & 2.4: COMPANY BUSINESS CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS & PARTIES TO THE APPLICATION

3.1. I deny the allegations that the business was carried on recklessly or with gross negligence. The e-commerce operations, built by the Second Respondent and his late partner, were highly profitable, generating R34.9 million annually. My role as CEO of RegimA Skin Treatments was to manage the brand, which I did successfully.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.4.2, 3.6, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.7, 3.7.2, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.13: THE RESPONDENTS

4.1. I confirm the identities and registration details of the Respondents. I deny the Applicant’s mischaracterization of our roles and conduct.

### AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES AND COMPANY

5.1. I echo the Second Respondent’s statements. The failure to disclose Mr. Danie Bantjies’s status as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust is a material non-disclosure. This concealment prevented me from understanding the true power dynamics and the severe conflict of interest under which Mr. Bantjies was operating. This is a direct breach of the principles of transparency and good faith required under the **Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988**.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1, 6.3, 6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE

6.1. I deny the Applicant’s claims. While he was involved in the initial formation of the companies, the growth and success, particularly of the e-commerce division, were driven by the Second Respondent. My role was to manage the brand, which I did diligently.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 7, 7.3, 7.6, 7.8, 7.10, 7.13, 7.16, 7.18, 7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

7.1. I deny these allegations. The Applicant’s claims of mismanagement are unsubstantiated.
7.2. On **May 15, 2025**, I confronted Ms. Rynette Farrar about a **R1,035,000 debt** owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance, a company owned by the Second Respondent. These funds were part of the estate of his late partner, Kayla Pretorius. This was an act of conscience and a fulfillment of my duty under **Section 9(1) of the Trust Property Control Act** to act with care, diligence, and skill.
7.3. Following my inquiry, on **May 29, 2025**, Ms. Farrar’s son’s company, Adderory (Pty) Ltd, registered the competing domain `regimaskin.co.za`. This action, taken shortly after my confrontation, suggests a reprisal for my inquiry.
7.4. Furthermore, on **August 11, 2025**, I signed a document backdating the Applicant’s designation as “Main Trustee.” Two days later, on **August 13, 2025**, I was included in this interdict. This sequence of events suggests I was being punished for supporting the Second Respondent and for questioning the financial conduct I had uncovered.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4, 8.5, 8.7, 8.10 & 9.2, 9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT

8.1. I deny any financial misconduct on my part or on the part of the Second Respondent. I refer to the Second Respondent’s detailed refutation of these claims. The alleged “unexplained” costs were the legitimate expenses of running a global e-commerce business.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1 through 10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT

9.1. I deny that I have acted in a manner that is delinquent, grossly negligent, or in breach of trust. My actions were those of a responsible trustee and director.
9.2. It is the Applicant who has acted in bad faith and for an improper purpose, in breach of **Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008**. His systematic destruction of the companies, his false claims, and his abuse of the court process are grounds for a declaration of delinquency under **Section 162(5) of the Companies Act**.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.8 & 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4: UK OPERATIONS & ALLEGED FRAUD

10.1. I confirm the Second Respondent’s statements. The Applicant’s claims are not supported by the operational realities of the business.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2 through 13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF

11.1. I deny that the Applicant has met any of the requirements for this relief. The balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors the setting aside of this order.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT

12.1. I deny the necessity of the constraints sought by the Applicant. I support the necessity of a forensic audit, provided it is conducted by an independent and impartial party, to fully expose the financial misconduct and conflicts of interest detailed in the Second Respondent's affidavit.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1, 16.2, 16.5, 16.6, 16.8, 16.10, 16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY

13.1. I deny the Applicant's claims regarding the discovery of my conduct and the urgency of the matter. The Applicant's delay in bringing this application, despite claiming knowledge of the alleged issues since mid-June 2025, contradicts his claim of urgency.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3, 17.4: EX PARTE BASIS

14.1. I deny that the urgency justifies the ex parte relief granted. The Applicant's material non-disclosures and manufactured crisis demonstrate an abuse of the ex parte process.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88: REMAINING PARAGRAPHS

15.1. I deny the allegations contained in the remaining paragraphs of the Founding Affidavit, including AD 18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, and 88, and put the Applicant to the proof thereof.

### CONCLUSION

16.1. This application is a personal vendetta masquerading as a legitimate legal dispute. The Applicant has abused his position as a director and trustee to punish his family and to seize control of assets he did not build. I pray that this Honourable Court will see through this charade and grant the relief sought in our counter-application.

## PRAYER

WHEREFORE, I align myself with the prayer of the Second Respondent and pray for an order in those terms, with costs to be paid by the Applicant on an attorney and own client scale.
