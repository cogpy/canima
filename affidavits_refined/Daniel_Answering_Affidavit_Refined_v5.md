## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

---

I, the undersigned

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1. I am a major male businessman residing at [ADDRESS] Bedfordview. I am cited as the Second Respondent in this application.
2. The facts contained herein are, save where otherwise stated or where the context indicates otherwise, within my own personal knowledge and are to the best of my belief both true and correct.

### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT

3. I have read the founding affidavit deposed to by the Applicant, my father, and I respond thereto as set out below. Insofar as I do not specifically deal with any of the allegations made by the Applicant in the founding papers, they are denied.
4. I depose to this affidavit for the anticipation of an ex parte order alternatively for the reconsideration of the ex parte order which was granted against the First Respondent and myself on 19 August 2025. A copy of this order is attached marked **"DF1"**.
5. The Applicant has used the process of this Honourable Court to obtain an ex parte order against the First Respondent and myself, resulting in our exclusion from the management of the businesses.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 1 & 1.3: APPLICANT'S PERSONAL DETAILS AND DECLARATION

6. I note the Applicant's identity and address. I deny the remainder of the allegations in these paragraphs.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 2 & 2.4: COMPANY BUSINESS CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS & PARTIES TO THE APPLICATION

7. I deny the allegations that the business was conducted recklessly or with gross negligence. The e-commerce operations, which I established and managed, were highly profitable, generating a combined annual revenue exceeding R34.9 million.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.4.2, 3.6, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.7, 3.7.2, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.13: THE RESPONDENTS

8. I confirm the identities and registration details of the Respondents. I deny the Applicant's characterization of our roles and conduct.
9. I am:
   - 9.1. Sole director of RegimA Zone (Pty) Ltd (2017/110437/07), RegimA Zone Academy (Pty) Ltd (2017/113134/07), RegimA Zone Impact (Pty) Ltd (2017/109415/07), ReZonance (Pty) Ltd (2017/081396/07) and Unicorn Dynamics (Pty) Ltd (2016/307425/07); and
   - 9.2. Co-director with the First Respondent of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07) ("RWD").

### AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES AND COMPANY

10. I note the reference to the Applicant's accountant. I draw the Court's attention to the material non-disclosure of Mr. Danie Bantjies's multiple conflicting roles, specifically his undisclosed status as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and his status as a Debtor to the Trust. This combination of roles creates an impermissible conflict of interest, which is a breach of the fundamental fiduciary duty of loyalty.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1, 6.3, 6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE

11. I deny the Applicant's claims regarding the corporate structure and relationships. The growth and success of the e-commerce division were driven by my late partner, Kayla Pretorius, and myself, entirely independent of the Applicant's involvement or financial support.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 7, 7.3, 7.6, 7.8, 7.10, 7.13, 7.16, 7.18, 7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

12. I deny the Applicant's claims of urgency and misconduct on my part. The alleged "crisis" was manufactured by the Applicant's own actions.
13. On **6 June 2025**, I cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant.
14. The very next day, **7 June 2025**, the Applicant unilaterally arranged for the cancellation of the UK business cards paying for the Shopify subscriptions (cards ending 5191 and 5225) without notice to myself or the First Respondent.
15. This action rendered documentation inaccessible, as systems required card-based authentication. The Applicant subsequently complained about missing documentation, a problem he created through his own card cancellation. This sequence of events demonstrates bad faith and is a clear application of the legal principle *venire contra factum proprium* (estoppel).
16. To prevent the collapse of the business operations, I was compelled to substitute my personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and the First Respondent her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4, 8.5, 8.7, 8.10 & 9.2, 9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT

17. I deny any financial misconduct on my part. The alleged "unexplained" costs were the legitimate expenses of running a global e-commerce business.
18. I refer to the unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each on 14 and 15 February 2025, totaling R900,000, from RegimA SA's bank account. These transfers were executed without my authority, in breach of fiduciary duties owed by the Applicant as co-director.
19. Furthermore, on or about 22 May 2025, the Shopify audit data for RegimA SA was expunged, reflecting zero sales for June–August 2025, which indicates deliberate data manipulation or deletion.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1 through 10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT

20. I deny that I have acted in a manner that is delinquent, grossly negligent, or in breach of trust. My actions have consistently been in the best interest of the companies I direct.
21. It is the Applicant who has acted in bad faith and for an improper purpose, in breach of **Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008**. His systematic destruction of the companies, his false claims, and his abuse of the court process are grounds for a declaration of delinquency under **Section 162(5) of the Companies Act**.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.8 & 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4: UK OPERATIONS & ALLEGED FRAUD

22. I deny the Applicant's claims regarding UK entities owing money to South African operations. The Shopify invoices (**DF5–DF7**) demonstrate that the actual payment flow is from the UK to South Africa, with UK entities funding SA operations to the tune of R 84,661+ annually. The Applicant's and Ms Farrar's debt allegations are demonstrably false.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2 through 13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF

23. I deny that the Applicant has met any of the requirements for this relief. He has no clear right, he has suffered no harm that he did not inflict upon himself, and he had alternative remedies available to him as a trustee. The balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors the setting aside of this order.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT

24. I deny the necessity of the constraints sought by the Applicant. I support the necessity of a forensic audit, provided it is conducted by an independent and impartial party, to fully expose the financial misconduct and conflicts of interest detailed in this affidavit.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1, 16.2, 16.5, 16.6, 16.8, 16.10, 16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY

25. I deny the Applicant's claims regarding the discovery of my conduct and the urgency of the matter. The Applicant's delay in bringing this application, despite claiming knowledge of the alleged issues since mid-June 2025, contradicts his claim of urgency. The R600,000 transfer is a pretext for an action motivated by the Applicant's desire to seize control of the businesses.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3, 17.4: EX PARTE BASIS

26. I deny that the urgency justifies the ex parte relief granted. The Applicant's material non-disclosures and manufactured crisis demonstrate an abuse of the ex parte process.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88: REMAINING PARAGRAPHS

27. I deny the allegations contained in the remaining paragraphs of the Founding Affidavit, including AD 18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, and 88, and put the Applicant to the proof thereof.

### CONCLUSION

28. This application is a personal vendetta masquerading as a legitimate legal dispute. The Applicant has abused his position as a director and trustee to punish his family and to seize control of assets he did not build. I pray that this Honourable Court will see through this charade and grant the relief sought in my counter-application.

## PRAYER

WHEREFORE, I pray for an order in terms of the relief sought in my counter-application, with costs to be paid by the Applicant on an attorney and own client scale.
