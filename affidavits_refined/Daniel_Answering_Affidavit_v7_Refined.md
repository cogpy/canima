*(and others)*

## I, THE UNDERSIGNED

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

do hereby make oath and state that:

---

### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY

1.1. I am the Second Respondent in this matter, an adult male South African citizen.

1.2. I am a Beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013). I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.

1.3. The facts contained in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, unless the context indicates otherwise, and are to the best of my knowledge true and correct.

1.4. Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives, and I believe them to be correct.

---

### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT

2.1. This affidavit is filed in opposition to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted against me and the First Respondent on 19 August 2025.

2.2. I respectfully submit that the ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, misrepresentation of facts, and an abuse of the court process. I therefore seek to have the order set aside.

2.3. In this affidavit, I will address the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in his founding affidavit, corresponding to the paragraph numbers (AD paragraphs) used therein.

---

### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE

#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty

3.1. The Applicant invokes legal provisions concerning a director's liability for breach of fiduciary duty. The evidence will show that my conduct as a director was at all times directed at advancing the interests of the companies. I built and managed a global e-commerce operation of over 51 Shopify stores generating approximately R34.9 million in annual revenue (Annexure **DF1**). The Applicant's allegations of misconduct arise immediately after I cooperated with his request to provide comprehensive financial reports to his appointed accountant on 6 June 2025 (Annexure **DF3**).

#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration

3.2. The Applicant's personal details are noted. The founding affidavit was commissioned by Mr. Danie Jacobus Bantjies, who is identified merely as "our accountant." As will be shown, Mr. Bantjies held multiple undisclosed roles, including that of a trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust. On 6 June 2025, I provided reports to Mr. Bantjies detailing financial misconduct within Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, an entity owned by the trust. I was therefore unknowingly reporting fraud to a conflicted and undisclosed trustee.

#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements

3.3. The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the entities under my direction proves the contrary. RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd operated 25 Shopify stores with R8.5 million in turnover, and RegimA Zone (Pty) Ltd operated 26 stores with R26.4 million in turnover. My late partner, Ms. Kayla Pretorius, and I built these operations from inception. After Ms. Pretorius was murdered on 13 July 2023, I continued to manage the operations profitably until they were systematically sabotaged by the Applicant and his agents.

#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction

3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. The trust has three trustees, but the identity of the third trustee, Mr. Bantjies, was not disclosed to me as a beneficiary until recently.

#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members

3.5. The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008. The evidence will show that it is the Applicant's own conduct that warrants such an order. On 10 June 2025, four days after I provided my reports to Mr. Bantjies, I requested an independent audit, which Mr. Bantjies dismissed. This was preceded by the Applicant cancelling 15 UK business credit cards on 7 June 2025, the day after my cooperation, an act of sabotage that contradicts any claim of acting in the companies' best interests.

#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife

3.6 The First Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and my mother. On 15 May 2025, she confronted Ms. Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023. These funds form part of the deceased estate of Ms. Pretorius.

#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son

3.7. I am the Second Respondent. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant presented me with two years of unallocated expenses from all group companies, improperly consolidated into RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd, and demanded sign-off within 12 hours for SARS submissions (Annexure **DF14**). I used the deadline extension (to 6 June 2025) to analyze these expenses, which led to my discovery of financial misconduct. On 6 June 2025, I reported to Mr. Bantjies that Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC was charging other group companies rent at an 86% profit margin (Annexures **DF2**, **DF3**).

#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments

3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) has owed R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Ms. Pretorius's deceased estate, since February 2023 (Annexure **SF6**). This debt was the subject of the First Respondent's inquiry on 15 May 2025. RegimA Skin Treatments CC receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).

#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK

3.9. The Applicant's reference to "Regim A UK" is ambiguous. The global e-commerce operations are owned and funded by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009), an entity my late partner and I established. UK bank records show that this entity continuously funded the South African Shopify platforms, with payments exceeding R84,661 annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**, **DF8**). The UK entity funded the SA operations, directly contradicting the Applicant's later perjurious claims that the UK operations were in debt to the SA companies.

#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC

3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. My financial analysis revealed an 86% profit margin on rent it charged to other group companies, which constitutes an excessive profit extraction mechanism (Annexure **DF2**). This was the misconduct I reported to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. At that time, Mr. Bantjies was, by his own admission, "running the companies." On 10 June 2025, Mr. Bantjies dismissed my request for an independent audit.

#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia

3.11 The property registration confirms the trust's ownership. The trust has three trustees, but the identity of the third trustee was not disclosed to me as a beneficiary until recently.

#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC

3.12. Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) recorded a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024 (Annexure **SF3**), representing 46% of its annual sales and a tenfold increase from the prior year. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) to RegimA Skin Treatments CC (Annexure **SF5**). In an email regarding a SARS audit, Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments for this stock (Annexure **SF4**), indicating a related-party transaction designed to extract funds.

#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics

3.13 The property registration documents are noted. The R5.4 million worth of stock that was written off as an adjustment from Strategic Logistics CC is the same type of stock supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments CC.

#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)

3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (totaling R900,000) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without my knowledge or authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account, which held a balance of R997,597.94 at the start of February 2025, was depleted to R5,284.08 by the end of the month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 being made during that period, proving active trade (Annexures **DF10**, **DF11**).

#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents

3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. A coordinated pattern of revenue diversion began with RegimA SA on 1 March 2025. The diversion of revenue from RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd commenced following a letter sent to ABSA Bank dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).

#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son

3.16. The Applicant's references are noted. As beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust, the First Respondent and I have a legitimate interest in ensuring the trust is managed in accordance with the Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988 ("TPCA"). Section 9(1) of the TPCA requires trustees to act with the requisite care, diligence, and skill in the interests of all beneficiaries. The Applicant has breached this duty.

#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation

3.17. Jurisdiction is confirmed. The Applicant's affidavit was commissioned by Mr. Bantjies, who signed as a "Commissioner of Oaths." The Applicant fails to disclose that Mr. Bantjies is also the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and a significant debtor to the Applicant, owing R18.685 million (Annexure **SF1**). This constitutes a material non-disclosure and a severe conflict of interest.

---

### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST

#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company

4.1. The Applicant identifies his accountant as Mr. Bantjies, who allegedly investigated financial discrepancies in mid-June 2025. The Applicant fails to disclose the following material facts regarding Mr. Bantjies's conflicting roles:

    4.1.1. **Trustee:** Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a fact concealed from the beneficiaries.

    4.1.2. **Debtor:** Mr. Bantjies owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure **SF1**).

    4.1.3. **Company Controller:** Mr. Bantjies was admittedly "running the companies" when I reported fraud to him.

    4.1.4. **Obstruction of Investigation:** Mr. Bantjies dismissed my request for an independent audit on 10 June 2025.

    4.1.5. **Financial Authority:** Ms. Farrar stated Mr. Bantjies instructed the payment of multi-million rand amounts, including the R5.4M stock adjustment (Annexure **SF4**).

4.2. This confluence of roles—Trustee, Debtor, Accountant, and de facto Financial Director—creates an irreconcilable and impermissible conflict of interest. This conflict, undisclosed to the Court, invalidates any claim of an impartial investigation and constitutes a breach of the fiduciary duties stipulated in Section 9(1) of the TPCA.

---

### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE

#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties

5.1. The Applicant misrepresents the operational control structure. Evidence shows Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts and the Sage accounting system (using the Applicant's email, pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions (Annexures **SF2**, **SF4**). The Applicant had no direct access to these systems.

#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities

5.2. The Applicant describes directorships. As co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd, I can confirm that on 14 and 15 February 2025, R900,000 was transferred from the company's account without my authority (Annexure **DF9**). Furthermore, on 30 March 2025, two years of unallocated expenses were improperly consolidated into RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd with a demand for my sign-off within 12 hours (Annexure **DF14**).

#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities

5.3. The Applicant's description of banking arrangements omits the systematic revenue diversion orchestrated by his agents. This pattern included: (1) diversion of RegimA SA revenue from 1 March 2025; (2) diversion of RegimA Worldwide Distribution revenue via an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025; (3) expungement of Shopify audit data on 22 May 2025; (4) cancellation of 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025; and (5) the transfer of R1.73M from company accounts on 11 September 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).

---

### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations

6.1. The Applicant's claim of urgency is contradicted by the two-month delay between the alleged discovery of misconduct in mid-June 2025 and the filing of this application in August 2025. The actual triggers for this application were my exposure of fraud on 6 June 2025 and the First Respondent's debt inquiry on 15 May 2025.

#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details

6.2. The Applicant claims his accountant noted discrepancies in mid-June 2025. This is a misrepresentation. On 6 June 2025, I provided my reports to Mr. Bantjies. The very next day, 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards essential to the operations (Annexure **DF4**). The crisis was therefore manufactured by the Applicant himself. He is estopped from complaining of a situation he created (*venire contra factum proprium*).

#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct

6.3. The Applicant alleges financial impact from my conduct. The evidence demonstrates that the financial sabotage was orchestrated by the Applicant and his agents. This includes: R900,000 in unauthorized transfers (February 2025); revenue diversion (from March 2025); Shopify data expungement (May 2025); domain theft (May 2025); card cancellations (June 2025); and warehouse sabotage (July 2025) (Annexures **DF9**, **DF12**, **JF4**, **DF4**, **DF13**).

#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations

6.4. The harm to the corporations was inflicted by the Applicant's agents. An email dated 20 June 2025 confirms an employee was instructed to divert customers from the established `regima.zone` domain to `regimaskin.co.za` (Annexure **JF8**). This competing domain is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son, thereby diverting revenue away from the Respondent entities.

#### AD 7.10 & 7.13 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions

6.5. The Applicant complains of service interruptions that were the direct and foreseeable consequence of his own action of cancelling the 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025. I was compelled to use my personal credit cards to prevent a total collapse of the business.

#### AD 7.16, 7.18, 7.20 - Alleged Interference

6.6. The Applicant's allegations of interference are unfounded. I was managing a profitable R34.9M-per-annum global e-commerce operation. The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who systematically dismantled the business after I exposed financial misconduct. My access to email and accounting systems was revoked in retaliation for my reporting of these irregularities.

---

### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES

#### AD 8.4 & 8.5 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies

7.1. The Applicant misrepresents the timeline of discovery. I discovered and reported the discrepancies to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's alleged "discovery" in mid-June was a pretext for retaliation. Furthermore, the investigation was conducted by the conflicted Mr. Bantjies, who had a direct financial interest in concealing the fraud.

#### AD 8.7 & 8.10 - IT and International Expenses

7.2. The Applicant mischaracterizes legitimate and necessary operational expenses for a global e-commerce business as "unexplained." These expenses relate to the 51 Shopify stores and associated software required to generate R34.9 million in annual revenue. The true financial irregularities are the R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC and the two years of unallocated expenses.

#### AD 9.2 & 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary

7.3. The Applicant's summary of financial misconduct is an inversion of the facts. The bank message regarding foreign exchange limits is a standard notification, not evidence of misconduct. The actual misconduct includes the R5.4M stock adjustment, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, and the excessive profit extraction by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.

---

### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: DELINQUENCY ALLEGATIONS

8.1. The Applicant's request to have the First Respondent and me declared delinquent is an abuse of process. Our actions were consistent with our fiduciary duties. It is the Applicant's own conduct that warrants a delinquency declaration under Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008.

8.2. The Applicant has: (i) grossly abused his position as a director and trustee; (ii) intentionally or by gross negligence inflicted harm upon the companies; and (iii) acted in a manner that constitutes gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and a breach of trust.

8.3. The Applicant acted in bad faith and for an improper purpose, in contravention of Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act, by manufacturing a crisis to conceal the financial misconduct I had exposed.

---

### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS

9.1. The Applicant's claims regarding the UK operations are perjurious. He alleges that UK entities are indebted to the South African companies.

9.2. The evidence proves the opposite. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK), which I established with my late partner, owns and funds the global Shopify platform. Bank records confirm that the UK entity consistently paid for the Shopify subscriptions for the SA entities, with payments exceeding R84,661 annually (Annexures **DF5-DF8**).

9.3. The Applicant's false statements are a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court and create a pretext for seizing control of the profitable UK-based operations.

---

### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: INTERDICTORY RELIEF

10.1. The Applicant has failed to meet the requirements for interdictory relief.

10.2. **Clear Right:** The Applicant has no clear right, as his actions were directed against the interests of the companies and the trust beneficiaries.

10.3. **Irreparable Harm:** Any harm was self-inflicted, resulting from his cancellation of credit cards and sabotage of warehouse operations.

10.4. **No Alternative Remedy:** As a trustee, the Applicant had numerous alternative remedies, including calling a trustee meeting or seeking an independent audit, which he failed to do.

10.5. **Balance of Convenience:** The balance of convenience favors setting aside the order, which has caused severe financial damage to the businesses.

---

### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FORENSIC AUDIT

11.1. I support the appointment of a forensic auditor, having requested one myself on 10 June 2025, which Mr. Bantjies dismissed.

11.2. Such an audit must be conducted by a truly independent party, not the Applicant's conflicted accountant, Mr. Bantjies.

11.3. An independent audit will confirm the misconduct perpetrated by the Applicant's agents, including the R5.4M stock adjustment, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, and the excessive profit extraction by Villa Via.

---

### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY

12.1. The Applicant's timeline regarding his "discovery" is a fabrication intended to conceal the retaliatory nature of this application.

12.2. The true timeline reveals a pattern of retaliation:

    12.2.1. **15 May 2025:** The First Respondent confronts Ms. Farrar over a R1,035,000 debt.
    12.2.2. **22 May 2025:** Shopify audit data is destroyed.
    12.2.3. **6 June 2025:** I provide reports exposing fraud to Mr. Bantjies.
    12.2.4. **7 June 2025:** The Applicant cancels 15 business credit cards.

12.3. The two-month delay between the alleged discovery and this application proves a lack of genuine urgency.

---

### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS

13.1. The Applicant was not entitled to proceed ex parte due to his failure to disclose material facts, including:

    13.1.1. The retaliatory timeline of events.
    13.1.2. The fact that he manufactured the crisis by cancelling the business credit cards.
    13.1.3. The severe and undisclosed conflicts of interest of his accountant, Mr. Bantjies.

13.2. These material non-disclosures are, I am advised, grounds for setting aside the ex parte order.

---

### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING PARAGRAPHS

14.1. I deny the allegations in the remaining paragraphs of the founding affidavit, which are based on the same false premises and misrepresentations addressed above.

---

### 15. CONCLUSION

15.1. The Applicant has abused the court process by bringing this application based on material non-disclosures and false statements. The application is a retaliatory measure designed to seize control of the companies and conceal the financial misconduct that the First Respondent and I had started to uncover.

15.2. The evidence demonstrates a coordinated campaign of sabotage against the businesses I built, orchestrated by the Applicant and his agents.

15.3. I respectfully request that the ex parte order be set aside, with costs awarded against the Applicant on an attorney-and-client scale.

**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**
