## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

---

I, the undersigned,

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. I am an adult female, the First Respondent in this matter. I am the wife of the Applicant and the mother of the Second Respondent. The facts herein are within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated or apparent from the context, and are true and correct.

1.2. I have read the Applicant’s Founding Affidavit and the Answering Affidavit of the Second Respondent, Daniel James Faucitt. I confirm the contents of the Second Respondent’s affidavit and incorporate them herein, insofar as they relate to me. This affidavit is made to confirm my son’s account and to provide my own perspective on the Applicant’s baseless and malicious allegations.

1.3. I deny the Applicant’s allegations against me. I have been dragged into this litigation as a form of punishment for fulfilling my fiduciary duties as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and for supporting my son, the Second Respondent.

---
### 2. MY ROLE AS TRUSTEE & THE APPLICANT’S RETALIATION

2.1. The Applicant’s case against me is not based on any misconduct on my part, but is a direct and malicious retaliation for my attempts to fulfill my fiduciary duties as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.

2.2. On **May 15, 2025**, acting in my capacity as a Trustee, I confronted the Applicant’s agent, Rynette Farrar, about a **R1,035,000 debt** owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, a company belonging to my son and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius. I informed Ms. Farrar that these funds were part of Kayla’s deceased estate and that withholding them was tantamount to “profiting from the proceeds of murder.” Ms. Farrar falsely claimed the debt had been paid.

2.3. The Applicant’s response was not to investigate this serious allegation, but to punish me. The retaliation was swift and systematic:
    - **One week later (May 22, 2025):** The Shopify orders for my son’s businesses were suddenly stopped, crippling his operations.
    - **Two weeks later (May 29, 2025):** A competing website domain (`regimaskin.co.za`) was registered by Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Rynette Farrar’s son, in a clear act of business theft.

2.4. The Applicant’s campaign of intimidation culminated on **August 13, 2025**, when he included me as a Respondent in this very interdict. This was the final punishment for my refusal to remain silent in the face of fraud and for supporting my son.

2.5. Two days prior, on **August 11, 2025**, I was deceived by the Applicant and his co-trustee, Danie Bantjies, into signing a document that backdated the Applicant’s designation as “Main Trustee.” I was not aware of the document's true implications and signed it under duress and false pretenses. This act of deception, immediately followed by the interdict, proves the coordinated conspiracy to oust me and seize control.

### 3. DENIAL OF ALLEGATIONS

3.1. I deny that I have acted in a manner that is delinquent, oppressive, or prejudicial. My actions have always been guided by the best interests of the companies and the beneficiaries of the Trust.

3.2. I have never been involved in the financial mismanagement alleged by the Applicant. On the contrary, it was my attempt to investigate financial irregularities that triggered his vindictive legal action against me.

---
### 4. CONCLUSION

4.1. I stand by my son and his account of the events. The Applicant’s affidavit is a work of fiction, designed to punish those who dare to question his authority or expose the malfeasance occurring under his watch. I have been targeted not for any wrongdoing, but for doing what is right.

## PRAYER

WHEREFORE, I pray that the Applicant’s application be dismissed with costs on an attorney and own client scale, and that the relief sought by the Second Respondent be granted.

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

Thus signed and sworn to before me at 
 on this the 
 day of 
 2025, the deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.
