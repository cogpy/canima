## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

---

I, the undersigned,

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. I am an adult male businessman and the Second Respondent in this matter, residing at Suite no. 132, Nicol Hotel, Corner Nicol Road and Skeen Boulevard, Bedfordview. The facts herein are within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated or apparent from the context, and are true and correct.

1.2. This affidavit is made in answer to the Applicant’s Founding Affidavit and in support of the relief sought by the First and Second Respondents. I will address the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the Founding Affidavit, under the corresponding paragraph numbers.

1.3. I deny the Applicant's allegations in their entirety, except where expressly admitted. The Applicant’s narrative is a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts, designed to conceal a systematic campaign of financial sabotage and to wrest control of businesses I built independently.

---

### AD PARAGRAPHS 1 & 1.3: THE APPLICANT

2.1. I admit the Applicant’s identity and address. I deny the remainder of these paragraphs.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 2 & 2.4: RECKLESS TRADING

3.1. I deny that the business was carried on recklessly. The opposite is true. From 2017 to 2025, my late partner, Kayla Pretorius, and I built and managed over 51 Shopify stores, generating a combined annual revenue of **R34.9 million**. This demonstrates prudent and successful business management, not recklessness.

3.2. The Applicant’s claim of reckless trading is a fabrication designed to justify his unlawful actions. The true recklessness lies in the Applicant’s systematic sabotage of these profitable operations, which I will detail below.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.4.2, 3.6, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.7, 3.7.2, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.13: THE RESPONDENTS

4.1. I confirm the identities and registration details of the Third to Ninth Respondents. I deny the Applicant’s characterization of their roles and my involvement with them, which I will clarify in the relevant sections below.

---

---\n
### AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTING OFFICERS

5.1. I confirm that Bantjes and Company CA(SA) are the appointed accounting officers. However, the Applicant makes a critical and material omission by failing to disclose the true nature of his relationship with Mr. Danie Bantjes, which extends far beyond that of an independent accountant.

5.2. Mr. Bantjes operates under a severe and undisclosed conflict of interest, holding multiple irreconcilable roles:
    - **Undisclosed Trustee:** He is a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a fact that was not disclosed to the beneficiaries, including myself and the First Respondent. This is a material non-disclosure under the Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988.
    - **Debtor:** He has a significant financial liability, with an investment payout schedule showing R18.685 million due by May 2026. This places him in a position of financial subservience to the Applicant.
    - **Company Controller:** At the time I exposed the fraud on June 6, 2025, Mr. Bantjies was effectively controlling the companies.

5.3. This combination of roles creates an impermissible conflict of interest. An individual who is a trustee, a debtor to the founder, and the de facto controller of the trust's assets cannot provide the impartial oversight required of an accounting officer. This conflict is not a peripheral issue; it is central to the entire fraudulent scheme, as it provided the motive and mechanism for the subsequent actions against me and the companies I managed.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1, 6.3, 6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE

6.1. I deny the Applicant’s portrayal of the corporate structure. The Applicant falsely claims to have created the Third to Sixth Respondents and their present directors/members. This is untrue.

6.2. I, along with my late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built the e-commerce operations from the ground up after the Applicant repudiated any relationship with us in 2016, telling us to "buy your own laptops and pay for your own office." We self-funded the entire operation, including the Shopify Plus platform that powers the 51 stores generating R34.9 million in annual revenue.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 7, 7.3, 7.6, 7.8, 7.10, 7.13, 7.16, 7.18, 7.20: ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT

7.1. I deny all allegations of mismanagement. The Applicant’s claims are a classic case of a manufactured crisis, where he created the very problems he now complains of.

7.2. **Card Cancellations (AD 7.13, 7.20):** The Applicant admits to cancelling the business bank cards in June 2025. This was a deliberate act of sabotage. On **June 6, 2025**, I cooperated fully with the Applicant’s request for financial information. The very next day, **June 7, 2025**, the Applicant cancelled the cards, cutting off access to the very systems needed to provide the requested documentation. This is not the action of a concerned director; it is the action of a saboteur.

7.3. **Financial Harm (AD 7.6):** The Applicant’s claim that I caused financial harm is baseless. The R500,000 loan mentioned was part of the normal course of business. The real financial harm was caused by the Applicant’s own actions, including the warehouse sabotage and the unauthorized transfer of R900,000 from RegimA SA’s bank account in February 2025.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4, 8.5, 8.7, 8.10 & 9.2, 9.3: FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT

8.1. I deny the allegations of financial misconduct. The Applicant’s claims of “unexplained” and “unexplainable” expenses are deliberately misleading and ignore the nature of the global e-commerce business I built.

8.2. **Computer-Related Costs (AD 8.7):** The Applicant points to R8.85 million in computer-related costs over two years as evidence of misconduct. This is false. These costs are the necessary operational expenses for running a global e-commerce platform with 51 Shopify stores, generating R34.9 million in annual revenue. These expenses, which amount to just 4.6% of revenue, are well within the 5-10% industry benchmark for a technology-driven business. They include Shopify Plus subscriptions, server costs, software licenses, and other essential infrastructure. The Applicant’s failure to understand these costs demonstrates his complete detachment from the business's operations.

8.3. **International Expenses & Tax Implications (AD 9.2):** The Applicant’s alarm over international expenses is feigned. A global e-commerce business naturally incurs international costs. The true tax problem was created by the Applicant’s own agents. For two years (July 2023 - March 2025), the accounting system was controlled by Rynette Farrar, who failed to allocate expenses. Then, on **March 30, 2025**, she and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses on me with a 12-hour deadline to sign off for SARS submissions. This was a trap, designed to make proper accounting impossible.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1 through 10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT

9.1. I deny that my wife or I have acted in a manner that is delinquent, grossly negligent, or in breach of trust. The Applicant’s allegations in this regard are without merit and are a complete inversion of the truth. The application to declare us delinquent is a malicious and baseless attempt to remove us from the companies we built and to conceal the Applicant's own unlawful conduct.

9.2. The Applicant’s reliance on Sections 42 and 47 of the Close Corporations Act and Section 162 of the Companies Act is misplaced. It is the Applicant and his agents, not the Respondents, who have acted in a manner that is grossly negligent, inflicted harm upon the companies, and breached their fiduciary duties.

9.3. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the Applicant, in concert with Mr. Danie Bantjes and Ms. Rynette Farrar, has engaged in a systematic campaign of financial sabotage, perjury, and fraud. This includes:
    - The deliberate destruction of a R34.9 million-a-year e-commerce business through warehouse sabotage and revenue hijacking.
    - The perjury committed by the Applicant in his Founding Affidavit regarding the reasons for the interdict and the state of the companies.
    - The undisclosed conflict of interest of Mr. Bantjes, who acted as Trustee, accountant, and debtor to the Applicant.
    - The transfer pricing abuse scheme involving Strategic Logistics CC, Adderory (Pty) Ltd, and RegimA Skin Treatments CC.

9.4. I submit that it is the Applicant, Peter Andrew Faucitt, who should be declared a delinquent director under Section 162 of the Companies Act. His actions have caused immense financial and reputational damage to the companies and have been carried out with a clear intent to defraud the Respondents and the beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.8 & 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4: UK OPERATIONS & ALLEGED FRAUD

10.1. I deny these allegations in their entirety. The Applicant’s narrative regarding the UK operations is a complete fabrication and demonstrates a profound and willful ignorance of the business he purports to manage. His claims of a “ruse” and “misappropriated” money are a deliberate attempt to mislead this Honourable Court.

10.2. **The Payment Flow is Reversed – UK Funds South Africa:** The Applicant’s central claim—that the UK branch fails to pay the South African companies—is perjurious. The commercial reality is the exact opposite. My independent UK company, RegimA Zone Ltd, has been **funding** the South African Shopify operations for years. Invoices show that UK-based cards paid for the Shopify Plus subscriptions for RegimA SA, RegimA Zone, and RWD, amounting to over **R84,661 annually**. The Applicant’s claim of non-payment is not just false; it is the inverse of the truth.

10.3. **The “Ubuntu Principle” – A Vision of Support, Not Theft:** The Applicant’s feigned concern about the UK branch’s finances is rendered absurd by the “Ubuntu Principle.” This was a multi-year project, 90% complete by May 2025, to transfer over **R100 million** from the successful UK platform *to* the South African companies. This initiative, conceived by my late partner Kayla and myself, was designed to protect the South African businesses and their employees. The Applicant’s sabotage campaign halted this vital transfer just weeks from completion, proving his true intent was destruction, not protection.

10.4. **The Threat of Insolvency is of the Applicant’s Own Making:** The Applicant’s prediction of insolvency is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The only reason these companies face financial distress is due to his own malicious actions, including:
    - Blocking **R34.9 million** in annual revenue by sabotaging the warehouse.
    - Diverting clients to a new, competing website (`regimaskin.co.za`) registered by his agent’s son.
    - Illegally transferring **R900,000** from RegimA SA’s account.
    - Emptying the remaining accounts on **September 11, 2025**.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2 through 13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF

11.1. I deny that the Applicant has met any of the requirements for the drastic relief he seeks. The entire application is founded on falsehoods and manufactured urgency.

11.2. **No Clear Right (AD 13.2):** The Applicant has no right to interfere with the independent businesses I built. His attempt to claim prejudice is a smokescreen for his true motive: to seize control of profitable assets he did not create and to silence me after I exposed his fraud.

11.3. **No Injury or Apprehension of Harm (AD 13.2.2, 13.3):** The only injury has been self-inflicted. The Applicant’s own actions—sabotaging the warehouse, cancelling cards, and diverting revenue—are the sole cause of any harm to the corporations. His apprehension is not of harm *to* the companies, but of being held accountable for his own fraudulent conduct.

11.4. **Alternative Remedy Exists (AD 13.4):** The Applicant had a far simpler and more direct remedy available. As the self-proclaimed "Main Trustee" with allegedly absolute powers, he could have addressed any legitimate concerns internally. The fact that he bypassed the Trust and rushed to Court with a baseless ex-parte application proves his motive was not to solve a problem, but to create one. This is a classic case of abuse of process.

11.5. **Balance of Convenience (AD 13.5):** The balance of convenience weighs overwhelmingly in favour of the Respondents. The interdict has caused catastrophic and irreparable harm, destroying a R34.9 million-a-year business and jeopardizing the livelihoods of thousands of people involved in the supply chain. Setting aside the interdict and restoring operations is the only just and equitable course of action.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1 through 14.5: FORENSIC AUDIT

12.1. I consent to a full, independent forensic audit. However, this audit must not be the limited, self-serving investigation proposed by the Applicant. It must be a comprehensive audit of the entire group, including the entities controlled by the Applicant and his agents.

12.2. The audit must specifically investigate:
    - The **R5.4 million stock adjustment** in Strategic Logistics CC (SLG) and the related-party transactions with Adderory (Pty) Ltd.
    - The **two-year accounting blackout** and the subsequent dumping of unallocated expenses.
    - The **R18.685 million debt** owed to Mr. Bantjies and his conflicting roles as trustee, debtor, and accountant.
    - The **R900,000 in unauthorized transfers** from RegimA SA in February 2025.
    - The **86% profit margin** extracted by the Trust-owned Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1 through 16.12 & 17.3, 17.4, 18.3: URGENCY

13.1. The Applicant’s claim of urgency is a fabrication. The facts demonstrate a calculated and deliberate delay, proving the absence of any genuine urgency.

13.2. **Calculated Delay:** The Applicant claims he discovered the alleged misconduct in “mid-June 2025.” Yet, he waited **67 days** until **August 13, 2025**, to bring this supposedly “urgent” application. This delay is inexplicable if the threat was as dire as he claims. Furthermore, after obtaining the ex-parte order, he waited another **6 days**, until **August 19, 2025** (my murdered partner’s birthday), to have it served. This was not a matter of urgency; it was an act of calculated cruelty.

13.3. **The True Urgency:** The real urgency is the ongoing daily harm caused by the Applicant’s interdict. Every day that the warehouse remains closed and the Shopify stores are offline, the businesses I built are bleeding customers, goodwill, and revenue. That is the only urgency this Court should consider.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 20, 22, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88: MISCELLANEOUS & DENIALS

14.1. I admit my identity and address as stated in paragraph 20.

14.2. I deny the remaining allegations contained in these paragraphs, which are a mixture of irrelevant details and repetitions of previously refuted claims.

## PRAYER

WHEREFORE, I pray that it may please this Honourable Court to grant an order in the following terms:

1.  That the ex-parte order granted against the First and Second Respondents on August 19, 2025, be set aside.
2.  That the Applicant be interdicted and restrained from interfering in any manner with the e-commerce operations conducted on the Shopify platform by the companies under my direction.
3.  That the warehouse be ordered to immediately resume the fulfillment of all Shopify orders.
4.  That the Applicant and his agents be ordered to restore to me full and unfettered access to all company bank accounts, accounting systems, email accounts, and other administrative platforms.
5.  That a full, independent forensic audit be conducted into the financial affairs of the Third to Sixth Respondents, as well as the Faucitt Family Trust, with a specific focus on the issues raised in paragraph 12.2 of this affidavit.
6.  That the Applicant be ordered to pay the costs of this application on an attorney and own client scale.
7.  Further and/or alternative relief.
