## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

---

I, the undersigned,

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. I am an adult female, the First Respondent in this matter, residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. The facts herein are within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated or apparent from the context, and are true and correct.

1.2. I have read the Answering Affidavit of the Second Respondent, Daniel James Faucitt, and I confirm the contents thereof as true and correct in so far as they relate to me. I align myself with the submissions made by the Second Respondent and will not repeat them, save where necessary to provide my own perspective.

1.3. This application is a vindictive and malicious abuse of process. The Applicant, my husband, has fabricated a crisis to punish me for fulfilling my fiduciary duties as a trustee and for supporting my son, the Second Respondent, against a campaign of blatant fraud and sabotage.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 1 & 1.3: THE APPLICANT

2.1. I admit the Applicant’s identity and address. I deny the remainder of these paragraphs.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 2 & 2.4: RECKLESS TRADING

3.1. I deny these allegations. The business was not carried on recklessly. The e-commerce operations, built by my son and his late partner, were highly profitable, generating R34.9 million annually. My role as CEO of RegimA Skin Treatments was to manage the brand, which I did successfully for many years. The only reckless conduct has been that of the Applicant, who has systematically destroyed the businesses we all built.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.4.2, 3.6, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.7, 3.7.2, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.13: THE RESPONDENTS

4.1. I confirm the identities and registration details of the Respondents. I deny the Applicant’s mischaracterization of our roles.

### AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTING OFFICERS

5.1. I echo the Second Respondent’s statements. The failure to disclose Mr. Danie Bantjes’s status as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust is a material non-disclosure. As a co-trustee and beneficiary, I was kept in the dark. This concealment prevented me from understanding the true power dynamics and the severe conflict of interest under which Mr. Bantjes was operating. This is a direct breach of the principles of transparency and good faith required under the **Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988**.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1, 6.3, 6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE

6.1. I deny the Applicant’s claims. While he was involved in the initial formation of the companies, the growth and success, particularly of the e-commerce division, were driven by the Second Respondent. My role was to manage the brand, which I did diligently.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 7, 7.3, 7.6, 7.8, 7.10, 7.13, 7.16, 7.18, 7.20: ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT

7.1. I deny these allegations. The Applicant’s claims of mismanagement are a smokescreen. The truth is that I was punished for performing my duties as a trustee.

7.2. On **May 15, 2025**, I confronted Ms. Rynette Farrar about a **R1,035,000 debt** owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance, a company owned by my son. These funds were part of the estate of his late partner, Kayla Pretorius. I informed Ms. Farrar that withholding these funds amounted to profiting from the proceeds of murder. This was not an act of mismanagement; it was an act of conscience and a fulfillment of my duty under **Section 9(1) of the Trust Property Control Act** to act with care, diligence, and skill. A trustee cannot turn a blind eye to the misappropriation of funds, especially when they belong to a deceased person’s estate.

7.3. The Applicant’s response was not to investigate the debt, but to punish me. Fourteen days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar, on **May 29, 2025**, her son’s company, Adderory (Pty) Ltd, registered the competing domain `regimaskin.co.za`. This was the first step in a coordinated plan to hijack the business, and it was a direct reprisal for my inquiry.

7.4. Furthermore, on **August 11, 2025**, I was deceived into signing a document backdating the Applicant’s designation as “Main Trustee.” Just two days later, on **August 13, 2025**, I was included in this very interdict. The message was clear: I was being punished for the “crime” of helping my son and for daring to question the financial misconduct I had uncovered. This is a gross abuse of the Applicant’s position as a trustee and a violation of his fiduciary duties to me as a beneficiary.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4, 8.5, 8.7, 8.10 & 9.2, 9.3: FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT

8.1. I deny any financial misconduct on my part or on the part of the Second Respondent. I refer to the Second Respondent’s detailed refutation of these claims. The alleged “unexplained” costs were the legitimate expenses of running a global e-commerce business.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1 through 10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT

9.1. I deny that I have acted in a manner that is delinquent, grossly negligent, or in breach of trust. My actions were those of a responsible trustee and director. I investigated a significant debt, I supported the profitable operations of the companies, and I acted in the best interests of the beneficiaries.

9.2. It is the Applicant who has acted delinquently. His actions, as detailed in the Second Respondent’s affidavit, constitute a textbook case of a director acting in bad faith and for an improper purpose, in breach of **Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008**. His systematic destruction of the companies, his perjury in the Founding Affidavit, and his abuse of the court process are all grounds for a declaration of delinquency under **Section 162(5) of the Companies Act**.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.8 & 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4: UK OPERATIONS & ALLEGED FRAUD

10.1. I confirm the Second Respondent’s statements. The Applicant’s claims are false and demonstrate his complete detachment from the operational realities of the business.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2 through 13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF

11.1. I deny that the Applicant has met any of the requirements for this relief. He has no clear right, he has suffered no harm that he did not inflict upon himself, and he had alternative remedies available to him as a trustee. The balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors the setting aside of this draconian order, which has caused immense and irreparable harm.

### CONCLUSION

12.1. This application is a travesty of justice. It is a personal vendetta masquerading as a legitimate legal dispute. The Applicant has abused his position as a husband, a father, and a trustee to punish his family and to seize control of assets he did not build. I pray that this Honourable Court will see through this charade and grant the relief sought in our counter-application.

---

## PRAYER

WHEREFORE, I align myself with the prayer of the Second Respondent and pray for an order in those terms, with costs to be paid by the Applicant on an attorney and own client scale.

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

Thus signed and sworn to before me at 
 on this the 
 day of 
 2025, the deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.
