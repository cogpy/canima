## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

---

I, the undersigned,

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. I am an adult female and the First Respondent in this matter. I am the wife of the Applicant and the mother of the Second Respondent. The facts herein are within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated or apparent from the context, and are true and correct.

1.2. I have read the Applicant’s Founding Affidavit and the Answering Affidavit of the Second Respondent, Daniel James Faucitt. I confirm the contents of the Second Respondent’s affidavit and incorporate them herein, insofar as they relate to me.

1.3. The allegations made against me by the Applicant are denied. My inclusion in this litigation appears to be related to my actions as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and my support for the Second Respondent.

---
### 2. MY ROLE AS TRUSTEE AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

2.1. The Applicant’s allegations against me are not supported by any evidence of misconduct. The sequence of events suggests that this application is a response to my actions in fulfilling my fiduciary duties as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.

2.2. On **May 15, 2025**, in my capacity as a Trustee, I raised a query with the Applicant’s agent, Ms. Rynette Farrar, regarding a debt of **R1,035,000** owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, a company associated with the Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius. I expressed my view that withholding these funds was improper, given that they formed part of a deceased estate. Ms. Farrar incorrectly stated that the debt had been settled.

2.3. Following this inquiry, a series of events occurred:
    - **On May 22, 2025,** the Shopify orders for the Second Respondent's businesses were halted, which disrupted his business operations.
    - **On May 29, 2025,** a competing website domain (`regimaskin.co.za`) was registered by Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by the son of Ms. Farrar.

2.4. On **August 13, 2025**, I was included as a Respondent in this interdict. This followed my inquiry into the financial affairs of the Trust.

2.5. On **August 11, 2025**, two days prior to the interdict, I was asked by the Applicant and his co-trustee, Mr. Danie Bantjies, to sign a document which backdated the Applicant’s designation as “Main Trustee.” I was not fully aware of the document's legal implications at the time of signing. The timing of this event in relation to the interdict is noteworthy.

### 3. DENIAL OF ALLEGATIONS

3.1. I deny that I have acted in a manner that is delinquent, oppressive, or prejudicial. My actions have been consistent with my fiduciary duties and the best interests of the beneficiaries of the Trust.

3.2. I have not been involved in any of the financial mismanagement alleged by the Applicant. To the contrary, this application appears to have been precipitated by my attempts to investigate financial irregularities.

---
### 4. CONCLUSION

4.1. I corroborate the account of events as set out in the Second Respondent’s affidavit. It is submitted that the Applicant’s allegations are not supported by the available evidence. My inclusion as a party to these proceedings appears to be a consequence of my actions as a trustee in seeking to protect the interests of the beneficiaries.

## PRAYER

WHEREFORE, I pray that the Applicant’s application be dismissed with costs, and that the relief sought by the Second Respondent be granted.

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

Thus signed and sworn to before me at 
 on this the 
 day of 
 2025, the deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.
