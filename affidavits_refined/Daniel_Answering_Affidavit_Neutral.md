## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

---

I, the undersigned,

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. I am an adult male businessman and the Second Respondent in this matter, residing at Suite no. 132, Nicol Hotel, Corner Nicol Road and Skeen Boulevard, Bedfordview. The facts herein are within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated or apparent from the context, and are true and correct.

1.2. This affidavit is made in answer to the Applicant’s Founding Affidavit. I will address the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the Founding Affidavit, under the corresponding paragraph numbers.

1.3. I deny the Applicant's allegations, except where expressly admitted. The contents of the Applicant's affidavit are, in material respects, inconsistent with the facts and documentary evidence which will be presented herein.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 1 & 1.3: THE APPLICANT

2.1. The Applicant’s identity and address are admitted. The remaining allegations in these paragraphs are denied.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 2 & 2.4: RECKLESS TRADING

3.1. The allegation that the business was conducted recklessly is denied. From 2017 to 2025, an e-commerce platform comprising over 51 Shopify stores was developed, generating a combined annual revenue of approximately **R34.9 million**. These results are indicative of prudent business management.

3.2. The Applicant’s assertion of reckless trading is not supported by the evidence. The financial performance of the e-commerce operations demonstrates a viable and growing business. The actions that have jeopardized these operations will be detailed in this affidavit.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.4.2, 3.6, 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.7, 3.7.2, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.13: THE RESPONDENTS

4.1. The identities and registration details of the Third to Ninth Respondents are confirmed. The Applicant’s characterization of their roles and my involvement is denied and will be clarified in the relevant sections below.

### AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTING OFFICERS

5.1. It is correct that Bantjes and Company CA(SA) are the appointed accounting officers. The Applicant has, however, omitted to disclose certain material facts regarding his relationship with Mr. Danie Bantjes.

5.2. In addition to his role as accountant, Mr. Bantjes is also:
    - A **Trustee** of the Faucitt Family Trust, a status that was not disclosed to the beneficiaries.
    - A **Debtor** to the Applicant, with a debt of R18.685 million.

5.3. These dual roles give rise to a conflict of interest, which is a material consideration for this Honourable Court.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1, 6.3, 6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE

6.1. The Applicant’s description of the corporate structure is inaccurate. The claim that the Applicant created the Third to Sixth Respondents and appointed their current directors/members is denied.

6.2. The e-commerce operations were established independently by myself and my late partner, Kayla Pretorius, following a separation of business activities in 2016. The operations were self-funded, including the development of the Shopify Plus platform which comprises 51 stores and generates approximately R34.9 million in annual revenue.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 7, 7.3, 7.6, 7.8, 7.10, 7.13, 7.16, 7.18, 7.20: ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT

7.1. The allegations of mismanagement are denied. The evidence suggests that the issues raised by the Applicant are a direct result of his own actions.

7.2. **Card Cancellations (AD 7.13, 7.20):** The Applicant confirms that he cancelled the business bank cards in June 2025. This action was taken on **June 7, 2025**, the day after I had provided the Applicant with requested financial information. The cancellation of these cards impeded access to the systems required to produce further documentation.

7.3. **Financial Harm (AD 7.6):** The allegation of financial harm is denied. The R500,000 was a partial repayment of loans made voluntarily and involuntarily by the Second Respondent to the corporate entities. These loans arose from the financial difficulties created by the Applicant's actions. Any financial prejudice suffered by the companies resulted from the Applicant's actions, including the instruction to halt warehouse dispatches and the unauthorized transfer of R900,000 from RegimA SA's bank account in February 2025.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4, 8.5, 8.7, 8.10 & 9.2, 9.3: FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT

8.1. The allegations of financial misconduct are denied. The Applicant’s characterization of certain expenses as “unexplained” is incorrect and arises from a misunderstanding of the operational costs of a global e-commerce business.

8.2. **Computer-Related Costs (AD 8.7):** The Applicant refers to R8.85 million in computer-related costs over a two-year period as evidence of misconduct. These are, in fact, the necessary operational expenses for an e-commerce platform of this scale, which includes 51 Shopify stores and generates approximately R34.9 million in annual revenue. These costs, representing approximately 4.6% of revenue, fall within the typical industry benchmark of 5-10% for technology-related expenditures. The expenses include Shopify Plus subscriptions, server costs, software licenses, and other standard infrastructure costs.

8.3. **International Expenses & Tax Implications (AD 9.2):** The Applicant raises concerns about international expenses and their tax implications. An international e-commerce business necessarily incurs costs from international vendors. Any difficulties regarding the tax treatment of these expenses arose from the fact that for a period of approximately two years (July 2023 - March 2025), expenses were not allocated in the accounting system. On **March 30, 2025**, two years of unallocated expenses were presented to me, with a request to approve them for SARS submissions within 12 hours. This timeframe was insufficient for a thorough review and proper allocation of such a large volume of historical transactions.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1 through 10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT

9.1. I deny that the First Respondent or I have acted in a manner that is delinquent, oppressive, or prejudicial as alleged by the Applicant. The evidence does not support these allegations.

9.2. The Applicant cites various sections of the Companies Act and the Close Corporations Act related to fiduciary duties. It is submitted that, based on the evidence, the conduct of the Applicant and his agents should be scrutinized against these same principles.

9.3. The evidence will show that the Applicant, in conjunction with Mr. Danie Bantjies and Ms. Rynette Farrar, has engaged in conduct that falls within the ambit of the sections he himself has cited:
    - **Infliction of Harm (AD 10.9.2):** The instruction issued on **July 8, 2025**, to halt all Shopify orders resulted in the cessation of approximately 93.3% of the e-commerce operations' R34.9 million annual revenue.
    - **Abuse of Position (AD 40.9.4):** The Applicant's actions over a six-month period—including revenue diversion, card cancellations, and the registration of a competing domain—were detrimental to the companies while the liabilities remained with the corporate entities under my direction.
    - **Breach of Trust (AD 10.9.3.1):** The Applicant and his co-trustee, Mr. Bantjies, acted against the interests of the beneficiaries by, inter alia, instituting this application and failing to disclose Mr. Bantjies’ status as a trustee and a debtor to the Applicant.
    - **Personal Economic Benefit (AD 10.6.3):** A potential motive for the actions taken by the Applicant and his agents relates to a significant debt of R18.685 million owed to Mr. Bantjies, which becomes payable in May 2026. The timing of the events in question, particularly following the exposure of financial irregularities on **June 6, 2025**, is a relevant factor for consideration.

9.4. It is submitted that the Applicant’s allegations of delinquency are misdirected and that the evidence points to the Applicant’s own conduct as the source of harm to the companies.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.8 & 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4: UK OPERATIONS & ALLEGED FRAUD

10.1. The allegations in these paragraphs are denied. The Applicant’s description of the UK operations is inaccurate.

10.2. **Payment Flow:** The Applicant’s assertion that the UK branch fails to pay the South African companies is incorrect. The commercial arrangement involves the UK-based company, RegimA Zone Ltd, funding the Shopify Plus subscriptions for the South African e-commerce operations, including RegimA SA, RegimA Zone, and RWD. This amounts to an annual contribution of over **R84,661**. The payment flow is therefore from the UK to South Africa, not the reverse as alleged by the Applicant.

10.3. **The “Ubuntu Principle”:** This was a business initiative, approximately 90% complete by May 2025, to allocate a significant portion of the revenue from the UK-based platform (in excess of **R100 million**) to the South African companies. The purpose of this initiative was to provide financial support to the South African entities and their employees. The actions taken by the Applicant have halted this initiative.

10.4. **Threat of Insolvency:** The Applicant’s concern regarding the potential insolvency of the companies is noted. However, it is submitted that any such threat is a direct consequence of the Applicant’s own actions, which have included:
    - The cessation of business operations generating approximately **R34.9 million** in annual revenue.
    - The diversion of clients to a newly registered, competing website.
    - The unauthorized transfer of **R900,000** from the RegimA SA bank account.
    - The transfer of the remaining funds from the accounts on **September 11, 2025**.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2 through 13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF

11.1. It is denied that the Applicant has satisfied the requirements for the interdictory relief sought.

11.2. **Clear Right (AD 13.2):** The Applicant does not have a clear right to interfere with the independently established e-commerce businesses. The Applicant’s claim of prejudice is unsubstantiated.

11.3. **Injury or Apprehension of Harm (AD 13.2.2, 13.3):** Any prejudice to the corporations has been caused by the Applicant’s own conduct, including the cessation of warehouse operations, the cancellation of bank cards, and the diversion of revenue. The Applicant’s apprehension of harm is not well-founded.

11.4. **Alternative Remedy (AD 13.4):** The Applicant had a more direct and appropriate remedy available to him. As a trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, he could have addressed any legitimate concerns through the established internal governance structures of the Trust. The decision to proceed with an ex-parte application to this Honourable Court, rather than utilizing the mechanisms of the Trust, suggests an ulterior purpose.

11.5. **Balance of Convenience (AD 13.5):** The balance of convenience favours the Respondents. The granting of the interdict has caused significant and ongoing financial harm to the businesses, with annual revenue of approximately R34.9 million being disrupted. The setting aside of the interdict is necessary to prevent further irreparable harm.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1 through 14.5: FORENSIC AUDIT

12.1. The Respondents consent to a full, independent forensic audit. Such an audit should be comprehensive and should include all entities within the group, including those controlled by the Applicant and his agents.

12.2. The scope of the audit should include an investigation into:
    - The **R5.4 million stock adjustment** in Strategic Logistics CC (SLG) and any related-party transactions.
    - The reasons for the non-allocation of expenses in the accounting system for a period of two years.
    - The **R18.685 million debt** owed to Mr. Bantjies and his various roles as trustee, debtor, and accountant.
    - The **R900,000 in unauthorized transfers** from the RegimA SA bank account in February 2025.
    - The **86% profit margin** on rental income generated by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.

### AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1 through 16.12 & 17.3, 17.4, 18.3: URGENCY

13.1. The Applicant’s assertion of urgency is not supported by the timeline of events.

13.2. **Delay:** The Applicant states that he became aware of the alleged misconduct in “mid-June 2025.” However, the application was only brought on **August 13, 2025**, a delay of 67 days. A further delay of 6 days occurred before the order was served on **August 19, 2025**. This timeline is inconsistent with a matter of genuine urgency.

13.3. **The True Urgency:** The ongoing financial harm to the businesses as a result of the interdict is a matter of genuine urgency. The continued disruption of a business with an annual turnover of R34.9 million requires the immediate attention of this Honourable Court.

---
### AD PARAGRAPHS 20, 22, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88: MISCELLANEOUS & DENIALS

14.1. The Second Respondent's identity and address as stated in paragraph 20 are admitted.

14.2. The remaining allegations contained in these paragraphs are denied.

---

6.  That the Applicant be ordered to pay the costs of this application.
7.  Further and/or alternative relief.
