## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

---

I, the undersigned

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

Do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1. I am a major male businessman residing at [ADDRESS] Bedfordview. I am cited as the Second Respondent in this application.

2. The facts contained herein are, save where otherwise stated or where the context indicates otherwise, within my own personal knowledge and are to the best of my belief both true and correct.

### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT

3. I have read the founding affidavit deposed to by the Applicant, my father, and I respond thereto as set out below. Insofar as I do not specifically deal with any of the allegations made by the Applicant in the founding papers, they are denied.

4. I depose to this affidavit for the anticipation of an ex parte order alternatively for the reconsideration of the ex parte order which was granted against the First Respondent and myself on 19 August 2025. A copy of this order is attached marked **"DF1"**.

5. In this regard, and as I will demonstrate below, the Applicant has abused the process of this Honourable Court by surreptitiously obtaining an ex parte order against my mother (the First Respondent) and myself in terms of which we were essentially "locked out" of our own businesses so that the Applicant could take full control of the management of the businesses.

6. I am:
   - 6.1. Sole director of RegimA Zone (Pty) Ltd (2017/110437/07),
   - 6.2. RegimA Zone Academy (Pty) Ltd (2017/113134/07),
   - 6.3. RegimA Zone Impact (Pty) Ltd (2017/109415/07),
   - 6.4. ReZonance (Pty) Ltd (2017/081396/07) and Unicorn Dynamics (Pty) Ltd (2016/307425/07); and
   - 6.5. Co-director with the First Respondent of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07); and
   - 6.6. Co-director with the First Respondent of RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07) ("RWD").

7. The First Respondent is also a director of RegimA SA and RWD.

8. This Court has jurisdiction because the Respondents are resident and/or the causes of action arose within this Court's area and the harm is suffered here.

9. I seek this anticipation relief arising from ongoing interference with e-commerce operations conducted on the Shopify platform through South African entities under my control, and associated dissipation of assets.

### 3. URGENCY

10. The matter is urgent. Daily harm accrues through halted fulfilment, cancelled payment instruments and threatened deletion of digital evidence. There is no adequate alternative remedy: ex post damages will not restore lost goodwill, customers or destroyed audit trails; preservation is time-sensitive. I accordingly invoke Rule 6(12).

### 4. BACKGROUND & CHRONOLOGY

11. In 2016, after a serious business disagreement, the Applicant repudiated any operational relationship with me and my late partner, Kayla Pretorius. We were told to obtain our own equipment and premises and were physically excluded from the office and resources.

12. Kayla and I thereafter built independent ecommerce capability from my residence and, in 2016–2017, incorporated the companies listed in para 6. We self-funded equipment, Shopify subscriptions, QuickBooks accounting, domains and infrastructure.

13. On 26 July 2017, we onboarded to Shopify Plus (enterprise tier). Annexure **"DF2"** (email chain with Shopify Plus Launch Manager, Mr Richard Estabrooks) evidences our operational control and domain rzo.io usage.

14. From 2017, we deployed and managed 51+ Shopify stores across RegimA SA and RegimA Zone; RWD also utilised Shopify (store count presently being confirmed).

15. The Applicant stated explicitly: "You're on your own now, buy your own laptops and pay for your own office." This amounted to an unequivocal severance of business association, forcing us to build independent operations entirely separate from him.

16. Relying on our own resources, Kayla and I commenced home-based development, registering the companies listed above and investing in equipment, servers, Shopify subscriptions, and accounting systems without assistance or funding from the Applicant.

17. By July 2017, our operations had achieved Shopify Plus enterprise status, which required turnover in excess of R 13 million per annum. Annexed hereto marked **"DF2"** is the email thread dated 26 July 2017 between Kayla Pretorius and Mr Richard Estabrooks, Shopify Plus Launch Manager, confirming our onboarding and evidencing that the operations were wholly ours.

### 5. INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS & PLATFORM PERFORMANCE

18. From 2017 to 2025, Kayla and I (and thereafter I alone) developed more than fifty Shopify stores generating combined revenue exceeding R 34.9 million per annum.

19. Detailed historical performance reports are annexed:
    - 19.1. **DF3** – RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (25 stores; R 8.5 m annual turnover);
    - 19.2. **DF4** – RegimA Zone (Pty) Ltd (26 stores; R 26.4 m annual turnover).

20. These reports are auto-generated by Shopify Plus and therefore constitute independent contemporaneous records, admissible as reliable business documents.

21. The Applicant was never involved in these operations, had no Shopify admin access, and contributed neither intellectual capital nor financial support.

22. Accordingly, all goodwill, digital infrastructure, and client relationships in these platforms were created solely by my late partner and myself.

### 6. THE 2017 EMAIL & PHONE NUMBER EVIDENCE

23. As appears from **DF2**, Kayla Pretorius conducted official correspondence from kayp@rzo.io and listed the contact number 011 615 29869. The same number is now used by Ms Rynette Farrar, the accountant who controlled all financial systems.

24. This transfer of a proprietary business number after Kayla's death in July 2023 evidences identity appropriation and continuity of control by persons associated with the Applicant over assets belonging to my company. It is a tangible link in the chain of misappropriation.

### 7. FINANCIAL EVIDENCE & UNAUTHORISED TRANSFERS

25. Annexure **DF8** contains RegimA SA's bank statement for 5 February – 5 March 2025. The account opened at R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08, following two unauthorised transfers of R450,000 each on 14 and 15 February 2025.

26. These transfers, totalling R900,000, were executed without my authority, in direct breach of fiduciary duties owed by the Applicant as co-director.

27. The same statement reflects 169 customer deposits amounting to R566,598.57, confirming legitimate, ongoing trade and disproving any suggestion of dormancy.

28. This transactional evidence correlates with Shopify records showing R1,171,653.36 in March 2025 sales (**DF3**) and thus authenticates the platform data.

29. On or about 22 May 2025, the Shopify audit data for RegimA SA was expunged: the system reflects zero sales and "Store: None" for June–August 2025, while contemporaneous RegimA Zone figures remained normal. This 100 percent loss of audit data cannot occur naturally. It indicates deliberate data manipulation or deletion.

30. The erasure occurred 77 days after the R 900,000 transfers, corroborating a planned pattern of concealment. I have reported this to Shopify Legal Support and request that the Court compel full forensic logs as set out in Schedule 2.

### 8. THE JUNE 2025 CARD CANCELLATION - MANUFACTURED CRISIS

31. On or about 7 June 2025, the Applicant arranged for cancellation of the UK business cards paying for the Shopify subscriptions, namely cards ending 5191 (RegimA SA) and 5225 (RegimA Zone).

32. Neither I nor Ms Jacqueline Faucitt were notified. Consequently, automatic subscription payments failed and stores risked suspension. To prevent collapse, I was compelled to substitute my personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and Ms Jacqueline her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone.

33. This represents financial sabotage, compelling personal expenditure to sustain business operations, while the Applicant continued to benefit from co-directorship in RegimA SA.

**34. CRITICAL TIMING ANALYSIS - MANUFACTURED CRISIS:**

34.1. On **6 June 2025**, I cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant.

34.2. The very next day, **7 June 2025**, the Applicant unilaterally cancelled the business cards without notice.

34.3. This timing—card cancellation the day after my cooperation—cannot be coincidental.

34.4. The card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible, as systems required card-based authentication.

34.5. The Applicant subsequently complained about missing documentation—the very problem he created through his own card cancellation.

34.6. This constitutes a **manufactured crisis**: the Applicant created the problem he now complains about, a clear application of the legal principle *venire contra factum proprium* (estoppel—one cannot benefit from one's own wrong).

34.7. The **but-for causation** is clear: but for the Applicant's card cancellation on 7 June, the documentation would have remained accessible.

34.8. This manufactured crisis demonstrates **bad faith** and **consciousness of guilt**, as the Applicant sought to create a pretext for his subsequent actions while concealing his own role in creating the crisis.

34.9. Annexed hereto marked **"DF15"** is the email correspondence evidencing my cooperation on 6 June 2025 and the card cancellation records from 7 June 2025.

### 9. FALSE DEBT CLAIMS - PERJURY EVIDENCE

35. The Applicant and Ms Rynette Farrar have advanced, in sworn proceedings, that "UK entities owe money to South African operations."

36. The Shopify invoices (**DF5–DF7**) disprove this entirely. The actual payment flow is UK to South Africa, not the reverse:
    - 36.1. Card 5191/1927 (my UK card) funded RegimA SA;
    - 36.2. Card 5225/3212 (Ms Jacqueline Faucitt UK card) funded RegimA Zone;
    - 36.3. Card 7147 (RegimA Zone UK) funded RWD.

37. These facts establish that the Applicant's and Ms Farrar's debt allegations were knowingly false, constituting **perjury** and **fraud by misrepresentation**.

38. The evidence proves the exact opposite of their sworn claims: UK entities have been **funding** SA operations to the tune of R 84,661+ annually, not the reverse.

39. This perjury is material to the Applicant's case, as the false debt claims form the basis for his attempt to appropriate UK-funded operations.

### 10. BANTJIES' UNDISCLOSED CONFLICTS - CRITICAL PERJURY

**40. BANTJIES' MULTIPLE CONFLICTING ROLES:**

40.1. A critical undisclosed conflict exists that goes to the heart of this matter: **Mr. Bantjies** served in multiple conflicting roles:
      - (a) **Unknown Trustee** of the Faucitt Family Trust (never disclosed to beneficiaries);
      - (b) **Debtor** with an outstanding investment payout schedule (payments due May 2026, May 2027, May 2029);
      - (c) **Accountant** who controlled financial systems and gave instructions to Ms Rynette Farrar;
      - (d) **Company Controller** who was running the companies when I exposed the Villa Via fraud to him in June 2025.

40.2. Bantjies' trustee status was **never disclosed** to beneficiaries, constituting **material non-disclosure** under the Trust Property Control Act 57/1988. Beneficiaries cannot protect their interests if they do not know who the trustees are.

40.3. The combination of **Trustee + Debtor** creates an impermissible conflict: a trustee cannot objectively manage a trust when personally indebted to that trust. This violates the fundamental fiduciary duty of loyalty.

40.4. Annexed hereto marked **"DF10"** is the trust deed evidencing Bantjies' trustee status and the investment payout schedule showing his debtor status.

**41. RYNETTE'S CONTROL USING PETER'S EMAIL:**

41.1. Ms Rynette Farrar controlled all financial systems using the Applicant's email address (**pete@regima.com**), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025.

41.2. Despite Ms Farrar's sister, **Linda**, being employed specifically as bookkeeper, **two years of expenses** remained unallocated in the accounting system controlled by Ms Farrar.

41.3. This raises the critical question: why did expenses remain unallocated for two years when Linda was employed to do the books?

41.4. The answer becomes clear when examining the expense dumping pattern described below.

41.5. Annexed hereto marked **"DF11"** are the Sage screenshots showing Ms Farrar using pete@regima.com.

**42. BANTJIES' INSTRUCTIONS TO RYNETTE:**

42.1. When questioned about multi-million rand transfers, including the R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics (described below), Ms Farrar claimed to be acting under **instructions from Bantjies**, not the Applicant.

42.2. This is evidenced in an email related to a SARS audit concerning these amounts, where Ms Farrar stated "Bantjies instructed me" to make the huge payments.

42.3. This creates a clear inference: **Bantjies, not the Applicant, had ultimate control** over financial systems.

42.4. The Applicant, despite being the nominal Founder and Trustee, had **no access** to accounts or banks. All control was exercised by Bantjies through Ms Farrar.

42.5. This explains why Ms Farrar controlled the Applicant's email address: she was acting as Bantjies' agent, not the Applicant's.

42.6. Annexed hereto marked **"DF12"** is the email from Ms Farrar claiming "Bantjies instructed me" in the context of the SARS audit.

**43. TRUSTEE-DEBTOR CONFLICT ANALYSIS:**

43.1. The combination of Bantjies' roles creates multiple conflicts:
      - (a) As **Trustee**, Bantjies owes fiduciary duties to beneficiaries;
      - (b) As **Debtor**, Bantjies has a personal financial interest in trust assets;
      - (c) As **Accountant**, Bantjies controls the financial records that would reveal his debt;
      - (d) As **Company Controller**, Bantjies directs transactions that affect his debt repayment.

43.2. These conflicts are **impermissible** under trust law and company law.

43.3. Bantjies' instructions to Ms Farrar regarding the R5.4 million stock adjustment (described below) demonstrate how these conflicts operated in practice: a trustee-debtor directing multi-million rand transfers while having a personal financial interest in the outcomes.

43.4. The **material non-disclosure** of Bantjies' trustee status prevented beneficiaries from identifying and challenging these conflicts.

**44. LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE:**

44.1. Bantjies' undisclosed conflicts constitute:
      - (a) **Perjury** - Material non-disclosure of trustee status in legal proceedings;
      - (b) **Fraud** - Bantjies instructed R5.4M stock adjustment while being debtor with conflict of interest;
      - (c) **Breach of Fiduciary Duty** - Trustee acting with undisclosed conflicts;
      - (d) **Conspiracy** - Bantjies + Rynette + Peter coordinated fraud.

44.2. These conflicts go to the **validity of all transactions** directed by Bantjies through Ms Farrar, including:
      - (a) The R5.4 million stock adjustment;
      - (b) The two years of unallocated expenses;
      - (c) The expense dumping into RWD (described below);
      - (d) The R900,000 unauthorised transfers.

### 11. SYSTEMATIC FINANCIAL SABOTAGE (1 MARCH - 11 SEPTEMBER 2025)

**45. OVERVIEW OF SIX-MONTH SABOTAGE PATTERN:**

45.1. The warehouse sabotage (described in the Applicant's founding papers) was not an isolated incident but the **culmination of a six-month systematic pattern** of financial sabotage designed to destroy my ability to pay creditors while leaving me responsible for debts.

45.2. This pattern demonstrates **organisation, motive, and intent**, not random error.

45.3. The pattern consists of four coordinated phases:
      - **Phase 1:** Revenue Diversion (1 Mar - 20 Jun 2025)
      - **Phase 2:** System Access Sabotage (6-7 Jun 2025)
      - **Phase 3:** Warehouse Sabotage (post-7 Jun 2025)
      - **Phase 4:** Account Emptying (11 Sep 2025)

**46. PHASE 1: REVENUE DIVERSION (1 MARCH - 20 JUNE 2025):**

46.1. **1 March 2025** - Diversion started with RegimA SA. Revenue streams were redirected to alternative channels controlled by persons associated with the Applicant.

46.2. **14 April 2025** - Ms Rynette Farrar sent a bank letter for RegimA Worldwide diversion, instructing customers to make payments to alternative accounts.

46.3. **22-23 May 2025** - Orders were removed from Shopify. This occurred **7-8 days** after Ms Jacqueline Faucitt confronted Ms Farrar about the ZAR 1,035,000 debt owed to Rezonance (part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, described below).

46.4. **29 May 2025** - A new domain, **regimaskin.co.za**, was registered by **Adderory**, a company owned by Ms Farrar's son. This occurred **14 days** after Ms Jacqueline's confrontation.

46.5. **20 June 2025** - An email from Gee (warehouse staff) explained to Ms Jacqueline that she was instructed to send out a "don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za" email to customers.

46.6. These actions systematically diverted revenue from my companies to alternative channels controlled by Ms Farrar and her son's company (Adderory).

46.7. Annexed hereto marked **"DF13"** is the complete timeline with supporting evidence for each revenue diversion event.

**47. PHASE 2: SYSTEM ACCESS SABOTAGE (6-7 JUNE 2025):**

47.1. As described in paragraphs 31-34 above, on **6 June 2025** I cooperated by providing reports to the accountant.

47.2. The very next day, **7 June 2025**, the Applicant unilaterally cancelled business cards, creating a **manufactured crisis**.

47.3. This card cancellation rendered systems inaccessible and created the pretext for the Applicant's subsequent complaints about documentation.

47.4. The timing—day after cooperation—demonstrates **bad faith** and **consciousness of guilt**.

**48. PHASE 3: WAREHOUSE SABOTAGE (POST-7 JUNE 2025):**

48.1. Following the card cancellation, the warehouse was instructed to stop dispatching Shopify orders.

48.2. The Applicant claims this was done "under the Interdict," but to my knowledge, none of the Shopify platform-owning entities (RegimA SA, RegimA Zone, or RWD) are cited or bound by the Interdict.

48.3. If the Interdict does not include the Shopify companies, then the Applicant's instruction to the warehouse was **fraudulent**—a misrepresentation of the Interdict's scope to justify sabotage of companies not under interdict.

48.4. If the Interdict does include RegimA SA, then the Applicant **sabotaged his own company** (as co-director), a manifest breach of fiduciary duty under Companies Act Section 76.

48.5. Either way, the conduct is unlawful and constitutes:
      - (a) **Abuse of legal process** - Using an order against unrelated companies to cripple others;
      - (b) **Tortious interference** with contractual relations;
      - (c) **Breach of fiduciary duty** - Failing to act in good faith and for proper purpose.

48.6. The warehouse sabotage halted fulfilment of operations worth **R 34.9 million annually**, damaging reputation and customer relations.

**49. PHASE 4: ACCOUNT EMPTYING (11 SEPTEMBER 2025):**

49.1. On **11 September 2025**, accounts were emptied in a final act of sabotage.

49.2. This occurred **six months** after the sabotage pattern began, and appears to have been triggered by the fact that I was still managing to pay creditors despite six months of systematic sabotage.

49.3. The account emptying was designed to deliver the final blow: ensuring I could no longer meet creditor obligations.

**50. COMBINED EFFECT - SYSTEMATIC FINANCIAL SABOTAGE:**

50.1. The combined effect of these four phases was to:
      - (a) **Divert revenue** to alternative channels (Phase 1);
      - (b) **Block system access** through card cancellation (Phase 2);
      - (c) **Stop order fulfillment** through warehouse sabotage (Phase 3);
      - (d) **Empty accounts** to prevent creditor payments (Phase 4).

50.2. This left me **responsible for creditor payments** while **systematically destroying my ability to pay**.

50.3. The pattern demonstrates:
      - (a) **Organisation** - Coordinated actions across multiple methods;
      - (b) **Motive** - Appropriate failed operations at reduced value;
      - (c) **Intent** - Deliberate destruction of my ability to pay creditors;
      - (d) **Consciousness of guilt** - Manufactured crisis and fraudulent interdict use.

**51. LEX FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS - SYSTEMATIC SABOTAGE:**

51.1. This systematic sabotage pattern satisfies multiple legal principles from the refined lex framework:

51.2. **Revenue Stream Hijacking Indicators** (confidence: 0.95):
      - All 9 indicators present: revenue diverted to alternative channels, customer communications redirected, payment instructions changed, orders removed from systems, new domains registered, card cancellations preventing payment, email instructions to use alternative entity, timing pattern of diversions, responsible party left with creditor obligations, ability to pay sabotaged.

51.3. **Financial Sabotage Indicators** (confidence: 0.95):
      - All 7 indicators present: multiple sabotage methods, escalating pattern, coordination across entities, timing to maximize harm, target left with liabilities, target ability to pay destroyed, saboteur benefits from target's failure.

51.4. **Manufactured Crisis Indicators** (confidence: 0.96):
      - All 6 indicators present: cooperation followed by immediate adverse action, timing creates problem complained about, venire contra factum proprium, but-for causation, no reasonable explanation for timing, manufactured urgency.

51.5. **Timing Analysis Bad Faith** (confidence: 0.96):
      - Temporal proximity (day after cooperation) + lack of alternative explanation = bad faith inference.

51.6. The **overall confidence** across these four principles is **0.955 (Very High)**, demonstrating the exceptional strength of evidence for systematic financial sabotage.

51.7. Annexed hereto marked **"DF14"** is the comprehensive lex framework analysis for this case.

### 12. TRANSFER PRICING ABUSE THROUGH ADDERORY

**52. THE SLG → ADDERORY → RST PATTERN:**

52.1. A systematic transfer pricing abuse pattern exists involving Strategic Logistics (SLG), Adderory (Ms Rynette Farrar's son's company), and RegimA Skin Treatments (RST).

52.2. The pattern operates as follows:
      - (a) **SLG** takes a manufactured R5.4 million loss;
      - (b) **Adderory** acts as intermediary (Ms Farrar's son's company);
      - (c) **RST** remains profitable.

52.3. The same type of stock that "just disappeared" from SLG (described below) is supplied by Adderory to RST.

52.4. This creates a profit-shifting pattern: SLG loses, RST profits, with Adderory (Ms Farrar's son) benefiting as intermediary.

**53. R5.4 MILLION INVENTORY ADJUSTMENT - RED FLAGS:**

53.1. The R5.4 million loss in SLG was attributed to a "stock adjustment" reflecting that stock had "just disappeared."

53.2. This adjustment exhibits **eight red flags** indicating a manufactured loss rather than a legitimate adjustment:

      - (a) **10x prior year** - The R5.2 million adjustment is approximately 10 times larger than the prior year amount (~R500,000);
      
      - (b) **46% of sales** - The adjustment represents 46% of SLG's R11.3 million annual sales;
      
      - (c) **Negative inventory balance** - Finished goods inventory shows negative R4.2 million, indicating accounting fiction;
      
      - (d) **Stock "just disappeared"** - No physical inventory count, no reconciliation documentation;
      
      - (e) **Supplier relationship** - The same stock type is supplied by Adderory (Ms Farrar's son's company);
      
      - (f) **Timing** - The adjustment coincides with the 30 March expense dumping (described below) and the 6 June fraud discovery;
      
      - (g) **No physical count** - No evidence of actual physical inventory count supporting the adjustment;
      
      - (h) **No reconciliation** - No documentation reconciling the adjustment to actual stock movements.

53.3. When **all eight red flags** are present simultaneously, the inference of a manufactured loss (rather than a legitimate adjustment) becomes compelling.

**54. RELATED PARTY CONCEALMENT:**

54.1. The relationship between Ms Rynette Farrar (who controls all accounts) and Adderory (her son's company) was **never disclosed**.

54.2. This constitutes **related party concealment** under Companies Act Section 75, which requires disclosure of all related party transactions.

54.3. The concealment prevented detection of the transfer pricing abuse pattern: SLG → Adderory → RST.

**55. CONFLICT OF INTEREST:**

55.1. Ms Farrar's control of all accounts, combined with her son's company (Adderory) acting as intermediary in the SLG → RST transactions, creates an obvious conflict of interest.

55.2. Ms Farrar had the **motive** (benefit her son's company), the **means** (control of all accounts), and the **opportunity** (two years of unallocated expenses providing cover) to execute this transfer pricing abuse.

55.3. Bantjies' instruction to Ms Farrar to make the "huge payments" related to this stock adjustment (as evidenced in the SARS audit email, **DF12**) demonstrates the coordination between Bantjies (trustee-debtor) and Ms Farrar (accountant with conflict of interest).

**56. LEX FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS - TRANSFER PRICING ABUSE:**

56.1. This transfer pricing abuse pattern satisfies multiple legal principles:

56.2. **Transfer Pricing Abuse Indicators** (confidence: 0.95):
      - 7 of 8 indicators present: below-cost sales to related party, one entity consistently loss-making (SLG), related entities consistently profitable (RST), intermediary entity related to controller (Adderory = Ms Farrar's son), profit shifting pattern, no arms-length pricing, no transfer pricing documentation.

56.3. **Inventory Adjustment Reasonableness Test** (confidence: 0.96):
      - All 8 red flags present: adjustment exceeds 10x prior year, adjustment percentage of sales exceeds 20% (46%), negative inventory balance, stock "just disappeared" explanation, supplier related to controller, timing coincides with fraud discovery, no physical inventory count, no reconciliation documentation.

56.4. **Related Party Concealment** (confidence: 0.94):
      - All 6 indicators present: intermediary entity in transaction chain, controller related to intermediary, no disclosure of relationship, transaction pricing not arms-length, pattern benefits related parties, one entity systematically disadvantaged.

56.5. The **overall confidence** across these three principles is **0.95 (Very High)**.

56.6. Annexed hereto marked **"DF16"** are the SLG financial statements, Adderory records, and RST financial statements evidencing this pattern.

### 13. ESTATE PROCEEDS AND RETALIATORY ACTIONS

**57. KAYLA'S ESTATE - ZAR 1,035,000 DEBT:**

57.1. Following Kayla Pretorius's murder on **13 July 2023**, ZAR 1,035,000 owed by RST to Rezonance (part of Kayla's estate) has been retained without proper estate administration.

57.2. This debt was owed since **February 2023**, before Kayla's murder.

57.3. Under the Administration of Estates Act 66/1965 and common law public policy, **no person shall profit from the proceeds of crime or suspicious death**.

57.4. Funds forming part of a deceased estate cannot be retained by entities without proper estate administration.

**58. JAX'S CONFRONTATION - PROTECTED CONDUCT:**

58.1. On **15 May 2025**, Ms Jacqueline Faucitt confronted Ms Rynette Farrar about this ZAR 1,035,000 debt.

58.2. This confrontation constituted **protected conduct** under labour law and common law:
      - (a) **Fraud reporting** - Asserting that retention of estate proceeds is unlawful;
      - (b) **Asserting legal rights** - Demanding proper estate administration;
      - (c) **Refusing illegal conduct** - Refusing to acquiesce in unlawful retention of estate proceeds.

**59. RETALIATORY ACTIONS - TEMPORAL PROXIMITY:**

59.1. Within days of Ms Jacqueline's confrontation, retaliatory actions followed:

      - (a) **22-23 May 2025** (7-8 days later) - Orders were removed from Shopify;
      
      - (b) **29 May 2025** (14 days later) - New domain regimaskin.co.za was registered by Adderory (Ms Farrar's son's company).

59.2. This **temporal proximity**, combined with the **absence of any alternative explanation**, establishes a retaliatory pattern following protected conduct.

59.3. The timing is too close to be coincidental: confrontation about estate proceeds → immediate adverse actions.

**60. RETALIATORY ACTION INDICATORS:**

60.1. The following indicators of retaliatory action are present:
      - (a) **Adverse action follows protected conduct** - Order removal and domain registration followed confrontation;
      - (b) **Temporal proximity** - 7-8 days and 14 days respectively;
      - (c) **No legitimate business reason** - No explanation for sudden order removal or competing domain registration;
      - (d) **Pattern of escalating actions** - Part of broader sabotage pattern;
      - (e) **Disproportionate response** - Extreme actions in response to legitimate inquiry about estate debt.

**61. FIDUCIARY DUTY TO INVESTIGATE FRAUD:**

61.1. When Ms Jacqueline confronted Ms Farrar about the ZAR 1,035,000 estate debt, this constituted a **credible fraud allegation**.

61.2. Under Companies Act Section 76(3), directors have a duty to **investigate credible fraud allegations** and take appropriate action.

61.3. Instead of investigating, the response was **retaliation**: order removal and competing domain registration.

61.4. This demonstrates **consciousness of guilt** and **bad faith**.

**62. LEX FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS - RETALIATION:**

62.1. This retaliatory pattern satisfies multiple legal principles:

62.2. **Retaliatory Action Indicators** (confidence: 0.94):
      - All 5 indicators present: adverse action follows protected conduct, temporal proximity, no legitimate business reason, pattern of escalating actions, disproportionate response.

62.3. **Fiduciary Duty to Investigate Fraud** (confidence: 0.95):
      - Credible fraud allegation (estate proceeds retention) → Duty to investigate → Instead, retaliation occurred.

62.4. **Estate Proceeds Prohibition** (confidence: 0.97):
      - Public policy prohibition on profiting from suspicious death proceeds → ZAR 1,035,000 retained since Feb 2023 → Unlawful retention.

62.5. The **overall confidence** across these three principles is **0.953 (Very High)**.

62.6. Annexed hereto marked **"DF17"** are the Rezonance records showing the ZAR 1,035,000 debt, email from Ms Jacqueline's confrontation (15 May 2025), Shopify order removal records (22-23 May 2025), and domain registration records (29 May 2025).

### 14. POST-MURDER APPROPRIATION & ESCALATION

63. Following Kayla Pretorius's murder on 13 July 2023, the Applicant and persons associated with him immediately embarked on efforts to assume control of the group. Within days, attempts were made to:
    - 63.1. seize bank accounts;
    - 63.2. remove Kayla from CIPC records; and
    - 63.3. block system access.

64. By late 2023, they succeeded in wresting control of the Sage accounting system, precipitating a drop in RWD revenue from ZAR 19.8 million to ZAR 18.7 million. In 2025 the campaign intensified:
    - 64.1. 14–15 Feb – unauthorised R 900,000 transfers;
    - 64.2. 22 May – Shopify audit-trail erasure;
    - 64.3. 7 Jun – card cancellation;
    - 64.4. thereafter – warehouse sabotage.

65. This sustained sequence demonstrates organisation, motive, and intent, not random error.

### 15. WAREHOUSE SABOTAGE AND ABUSE OF LEGAL PROCESS

66. The Applicant procured an interdict against certain companies (the "Interdict"). To my knowledge, none of the Shopify platform-owning entities, RegimA SA, RegimA Zone, or RWD, are cited or bound therein.

67. Nevertheless, the warehouse was instructed, ostensibly "under the Interdict," to stop dispatching Shopify orders. This instruction halted fulfilment of operations worth R 34.9 million annually, damaging reputation and customer relations.

68. Such conduct constitutes:
    - 68.1. **Abuse of legal process** – using an order against unrelated companies to cripple others (Phillips v Botha 1999 (2) SA 555 (SCA));
    - 68.2. **Tortious interference** with contractual relations; and
    - 68.3. a **breach of section 76(3)(b)** of the Companies Act, requiring a director to act in good faith and for proper purpose.

69. If the Interdict indeed includes RegimA SA, then the Applicant sabotaged his own company, a manifest breach of fiduciary duty; if it does not, his representation that it did is fraudulent. Either way, the conduct is unlawful.

### 16. AGGREGATED FINANCIAL HARM

70. The direct and consequential damages are conservatively summarised below:

| Category | Amount (R) | Evidence |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Unauthorised transfers | 900,000 | DF8 |
| Revenue loss (annual) | 19,200,000 | DF3–DF4 |
| Forced subsidisation | 84,661 p.a. | DF5–DF6 |
| Goodwill & customer loss | 10,000,000 | NA |
| Business value appropriation | 109,855,296 | valuation |
| Warehouse sabotage (multi-year) | 78,000,000 | NA |
| Transfer pricing abuse (SLG) | 5,400,000 | DF16 |
| Estate proceeds retention | 1,035,000 | DF17 |
| **Total claim** | **≈ R 224 million** | |

71. The quantum illustrates the scale of harm; the immediate concern for this Court is preservation pending final adjudication.

### 17. LEX FRAMEWORK COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

**72. OVERVIEW OF LEX FRAMEWORK:**

72.1. A comprehensive legal aspects analysis was conducted on 30 October 2025, identifying **22 new legal principles** applicable to this case profile.

      - **Strong:** 7 principles (32%)

75.4. This exceptional confidence level demonstrates the strength of the evidence supporting my case.

**76. LEGAL CONCLUSIONS BASED ON LEX FRAMEWORK:**

76.1. Based on the lex framework analysis, the following legal conclusions are compelling:

      - (a) **Systematic Financial Sabotage** (confidence: 0.95) - The 6-month pattern (1 Mar - 11 Sep) constitutes systematic financial sabotage, not isolated incidents;
      
      - (b) **Manufactured Crisis** (confidence: 0.96) - The card cancellation day after cooperation demonstrates bad faith and manufactured crisis;
      
      - (c) **Transfer Pricing Abuse** (confidence: 0.95) - The SLG → Adderory → RST pattern constitutes transfer pricing abuse;
      
      - (d) **Retaliatory Actions** (confidence: 0.94) - The actions following Jacqueline's confrontation constitute unlawful retaliation;
      
      - (e) **Perjury** (confidence: 0.95) - The false debt claims and Bantjies' undisclosed conflicts constitute material perjury;
      
      - (f) **Abuse of Process** (confidence: 0.93) - The fraudulent use of interdict to justify warehouse sabotage constitutes abuse of process.

**77. OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**

77.1. The lex framework provides **automated legal reasoning** across entities, relations, events, and timelines.

77.2. The **very high confidence** (0.948 average) across 22 principles demonstrates the exceptional strength of my case.

77.3. The Applicant's allegations are systematically refuted by evidence-backed legal principles with quantified confidence scores.

77.4. Annexed hereto marked **"DF14"** is the comprehensive lex framework analysis document.

### 18. RELIEF SOUGHT
