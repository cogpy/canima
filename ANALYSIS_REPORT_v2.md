## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive legal analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding Case 2025-137857. The analysis reveals that the Applicant, Peter Faucitt, has initiated this litigation based on a series of false and misleading allegations designed to conceal a coordinated campaign of financial sabotage, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duties. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the Respondents, Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt, are the victims of this scheme, not the perpetrators of any misconduct.

The Applicant and his key agent, Mr. Danie Bantjes, have committed multiple, serious breaches of their fiduciary duties under the **Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988**, the **Companies Act, 71 of 2008**, and the **Close Corporations Act, 69 of 1984**. These breaches are not minor or technical; they are substantive, intentional, and have caused catastrophic financial harm to the trust and the corporate entities involved.

Conversely, the actions of the Respondents have been consistent with their fiduciary duties. Daniel Faucitt built and managed a highly profitable R34.9 million-per-annum e-commerce enterprise. Jacqueline Faucitt, in her capacity as a trustee, acted diligently to investigate the misappropriation of funds from a deceased person's estate.

This report concludes that the Applicant's case is without merit and should be dismissed. Furthermore, the evidence is sufficient to support a robust counter-application seeking:

1.  The declaration of Peter Faucitt and Danie Bantjies as delinquent directors.
2.  Their removal as trustees of the Faucitt Family Trust.
3.  A substantial damages award for the financial harm caused.

## 2. Analysis of Breaches of Fiduciary Duty by Trustees

The conduct of the Applicant and Mr. Bantjes constitutes a severe violation of the duties of a trustee as enshrined in South African law.

### 2.1. The Standard of Care for Trustees

**Section 9(1) of the Trust Property Control Act** establishes the standard of care:

> "A trustee shall in the performance of his duties and the exercise of his powers act with the care, diligence and skill which can reasonably be expected of a person who manages the affairs of another."

This duty requires, at its core, undivided loyalty to the interests of the trust and its beneficiaries. Both the Applicant and Mr. Bantjes have failed to meet this standard.

### 2.2. The Impermissible Conflict of Interest of Danie Bantjies

Mr. Bantjes operated under a triple conflict of interest that made it impossible for him to fulfill his fiduciary duties:

| Role | Conflict | Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trustee** | His status as a trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust was not disclosed to the beneficiaries. | This material non-disclosure prevented the beneficiaries from providing informed consent or from understanding the true power dynamics at play. |
| **Debtor** | He has a personal financial liability of R18.685 million, with a payout schedule dependent on the Applicant. | This financial subservience creates a powerful incentive to align with the Applicant's interests, rather than the beneficiaries'. |
| **Accountant** | He controlled the financial systems of the very entities he was supposed to be overseeing as a trustee. | This consolidation of power eliminates any semblance of independent oversight and creates an environment ripe for abuse. |

This conflict is a per se breach of the duty of loyalty. A person managing the affairs of another cannot be simultaneously indebted to a third party with an interest in those affairs and also be the gatekeeper of the financial records. The dismissal of the Second Respondent's request for an audit on June 10, 2025, is a direct consequence of this conflict.

### 2.3. The Applicant's Breach of Trust

The Applicant has weaponized his position as a trustee to attack the beneficiaries he is legally bound to protect. His actions represent a complete abdication of his fiduciary responsibilities:

*   **Sabotage of Trust Assets:** The deliberate destruction of the R34.9 million e-commerce business, a key asset of the trust, is a direct violation of the duty to preserve trust property.
*   **Actions Contrary to Beneficiaries' Interests:** Using trust-owned companies to launch a baseless legal attack on the beneficiaries is the antithesis of acting in their best interest.

### 2.4. Grounds for Removal of Trustees

**Section 20 of the Trust Property Control Act** provides for the removal of trustees. The conduct of both the Applicant and Mr. Bantjes meets the statutory thresholds:

*   **Section 20(1):** A court may remove a trustee if it is "in the interests of the trust and its beneficiaries." The removal of the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies is not just in the beneficiaries' interest; it is essential for the preservation of the trust itself.
*   **Section 20(2)(e):** The Master may remove a trustee who "fails to perform satisfactorily any duty." The failure to disclose conflicts of interest and the active sabotage of trust assets are clear failures to perform.

## 3. Analysis of Breaches by Directors and Members

The Applicant's conduct also constitutes a severe breach of his duties as a director and member of the various corporate entities.

### 3.1. The Fiduciary Duties of Members under the Close Corporations Act

**Section 42 of the Close Corporations Act** establishes a fiduciary relationship between a member and the corporation. The Applicant has breached these duties in multiple respects:

*   **Section 42(2)(a)(i):** He failed to act "in the interest and for the benefit of the corporation" by systematically sabotaging its operations.
*   **Section 42(2)(b)(i):** He allowed a "material conflict between his own interests and those of the corporation" to dictate his actions, prioritizing his personal vendetta over the financial health of the companies.

### 3.2. Liability for Breach

**Section 42(3) of the Close Corporations Act** holds a member liable for any loss suffered by the corporation as a result of a breach. The financial harm caused by the Applicant is substantial and quantifiable:

| Item | Amount | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Loss of Revenue | R17.45M+ | (R34.9M annual revenue / 12) * 6 months of sabotage |
| Unauthorized Transfers | R900,000 | Bank statements of RegimA SA (Feb 2025) |
| Strategic Logistics Stock Loss | R5.4 Million | Inventory adjustment records |
| **Total Quantifiable Loss** | **R23.75M+** | |

### 3.3. Grounds for Declaration of Delinquency

**Section 162 of the Companies Act** provides for the declaration of a director as delinquent. The Applicant's conduct meets the mandatory grounds for such a declaration.

**Section 162(5) of the Companies Act** states that a court **must** declare a director delinquent if they have, inter alia:

*   **(c)(iii) intentionally, or by gross negligence, inflicted harm upon the company...**
*   **(c)(iv) acted in a manner... that amounted to gross negligence, wilful misconduct or breach of trust...**

The Applicant's actions were not merely negligent; they were intentional and calculated to inflict maximum harm. The timeline of the "Nine-Prong Attack" establishes a clear pattern of wilful misconduct. As confirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeal in *Msibithi Investments* (2025), such "egregious breaches of fiduciary duties" are precisely what Section 162 is designed to address. The court has no discretion in this matter; upon proof of these facts, it must declare the Applicant delinquent.

### 3.4. Disqualification from Management

**Section 47 of the Close Corporations Act** provides for the automatic disqualification of a person removed from an office of trust on account of misconduct. A declaration of delinquency would trigger this provision, resulting in the Applicant's disqualification from managing any close corporation. This disqualification is then extended to company directorships via **Section 69(8) of the Companies Act**, creating a comprehensive bar from managing any business entity.

## 4. Strategic Recommendations for the Respondents

The Respondents are in a strong legal position. They should move from a defensive posture to an offensive one by filing a comprehensive counter-application.

### 4.1. The Counter-Application

The counter-application should seek the following relief:

1.  **Declaratory Orders:** Declarations of delinquency against both Peter Faucitt and Danie Bantjies.
2.  **Removal Orders:** The removal of both individuals as trustees of the Faucitt Family Trust.
3.  **Damages Award:** A quantified damages award based on a detailed schedule of losses, as outlined in Section 3.2 above.
4.  **Interdictory Relief:** An order interdicting the Applicant from any further interference with the business operations.
5.  **Costs:** A punitive costs order on an attorney-client scale.

### 4.2. Narrative Strategy

The Answering Affidavits should be restructured to lead with the Respondents' narrative of sabotage and fraud. The current structure, which follows the Applicant's affidavit, buries the most powerful arguments. By presenting a chronological account of the Applicant's misconduct first, the Respondents can frame his allegations as the desperate fabrications of a guilty party.

### 4.3. Evidence Presentation

The annexures should be leveraged as analytical tools, not just evidence dumps. Each annexure should have a cover page that summarizes the evidence and explains its legal significance. This will guide the court through the complex factual matrix and make the Respondents' case more compelling and easier to understand.

---

## 5. Conclusion

The Applicant has abused his position of trust and the legal process in an attempt to perpetrate a fraud. The law provides clear and powerful remedies for such conduct. The Respondents have a strong case for not only having the application dismissed but also for obtaining substantive relief that will hold the Applicant and his agents accountable for their actions and compensate the trust and the companies for the harm they have suffered.
