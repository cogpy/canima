## The Five Smoking Guns

### 1. **WAREHOUSE FRAUD (July 8, 2025)**
- Peter instructed warehouse to STOP SHOPIFY ORDERS
- R34.9M operations sabotaged (93.3% revenue collapse)
- POPI violations (10 years imprisonment + R10M fine)
- **Proves intent: DESTRUCTION (not management)**

### 2. **PERJURY (Multiple Instances)**
- Peter: "Erratic behavior" (after 165 days of torture)
- Peter: "Urgency" (67-day delay proves false)
- Bantjies: "No knowledge of crimes" (65-day timeline proves false)
- **Exposure: 15 YEARS PER COUNT**

### 3. **2-YEAR ACCOUNTING BLACKOUT**
- July 13, 2023: Kayla murdered → Law enforcement: "TOUCH NOTHING"
- 2023-2025: 2 YEARS NO BOOKS (despite Linda employed "just to do those books")
- March 30, 2025: Dump 2 years unallocated expenses (12-hour deadline)
- **Proves: OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE**

### 4. **R5.4M STOCK THEFT**
- R5.4M from Strategic Logistics (SLG) as "stock adjustment"
- Stock "disappeared" → Diverted to Adderory (Rynette's son)
- **Theft as Trustee → LIFE IMPRISONMENT**

### 5. **SARS AUDIT EMAIL**
- SARS was auditing and asking about huge amounts
- Rynette said: **"BANTJIES INSTRUCTED HER TO MAKE THOSE HUGE PAYMENTS"**
- **Proves: Bantjies' ultimate control (not Peter)**

---

## The Real Power Structure (3 Levels)

### Level 1: DANIE BANTJIES (Ultimate Controller)
- Trustee (Faucitt Family Trust - July 2024, covert)
- Accountant (RegimA companies - financial dependence)
- Commissioner of Oaths (dual role - witness + certifier)
- **R18.685M Creditor (first payment due May 2026)**

### Level 2: RYNETTE FARRAR (Executor)
- Controls Peter's email (pete@regima.com)
- Subscription owner (Sage accounting - controls all access)
- Controls all accounts (company accounts, banks)
- Takes instructions from Bantjies (not Peter)

### Level 3: PETER FAUCITT (Figurehead)
- NO ACCESS to accounts, banks, or email
- R18.685M debt to Bantjies (leverage)
- Puppet with no independent control

## The Ubuntu Principle

**Kayla's Vision (March 2020):**
> "Since the ZA companies helped UK out of the Isaac Chesno problem in 2015, we should find a way to attribute as much of the ZA revenue generated by the UK Shopify platform as possible to the ZA companies even though they were unable to generate it themselves and tell all the staff everything will be ok. Essentially Kayla proposed we give most of the money we made to the ZA companies to protect staff and ensure nobody was left behind."

**The Reality:**
- R208M accumulated on Shopify platform (51 stores)
- R100M+ being transferred to save ZA companies
- 90% complete by May 2025 (weeks from completion)
- Thousands of small businesses depending on success
- Tens of thousands of staff depending on completion

**The Destruction:**
- May 22, 2025: Orders stopped, data extraction begins
- June 7, 2025: Card cancellations (financial devastation)
- August 19, 2025: Interdict scheduled for delivery (weaponized grief)
- September 11, 2025: Accounts emptied (R1.73M)
- **90% complete transition STOPPED** (weeks from completion)
