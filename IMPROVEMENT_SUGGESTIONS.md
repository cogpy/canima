Ubuntu Principle"

**Challenge:** The "Ubuntu Principle" is a powerful narrative element, but its full emotional and strategic impact could be amplified.

**Recommendation:**

- **Humanize the Impact:** Go beyond the numbers and tell the story of the people affected by the sabotage. Include testimonials from small business owners, employees, or other stakeholders who were negatively impacted. This will put a human face on the abstract financial figures.
- **Connect to Kayla's Legacy:** Frame the sabotage not just as a financial crime, but as a betrayal of Kayla Pretorius's vision. Emphasize that the Applicant's actions directly undermined her altruistic goals, adding a layer of moral and ethical condemnation to the legal arguments.

### 1.4. Detail the Transfer Pricing Abuse

**Challenge:** The connection between Strategic Logistics CC (SLG), Adderory (Pty) Ltd, and RegimA Skin Treatments (RST) is complex and could be made more explicit for the court.

**Recommendation:**

- **Create a Visual Diagram:** Develop a clear visual diagram that illustrates the flow of goods and money between SLG, Adderory, and RST. This will help the court to visualize the transfer pricing scheme and understand how it was used to manufacture losses in one entity while generating profits in another.
- **Expert Analysis:** An expert in transfer pricing could provide a formal opinion on the scheme, confirming its illegality and explaining its mechanics in a way that is easily understandable to a non-expert audience.
