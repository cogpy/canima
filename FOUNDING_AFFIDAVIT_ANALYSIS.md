## 2. Key Claims and Allegations

### 2.1 Discovery of Financial Irregularities (AD Paragraph 7)

**Peter's Claims:**
- Mid-June 2025: Accountant (Danie Bantjies) attended office for provisional tax and VAT submissions
- July 2025: Bantjies noted "numerous discrepancies" and "irregular payments" in banking accounts
- Payments related to IT expenses under Daniel's purview
- Daniel's conduct described as "increasingly erratic"
- Peter cancelled business bank cards (including his own) in June 2025
- Requested invoices and proof of expenses from Daniel
- Daniel provided "a few" but "majority of transactions remain unexplained"
- Some subscriptions (internet domains, etc.) were halted due to card cancellations
- Daniel "adopted a 'superior' position and effectively refused to assist"

**Material Non-Disclosures Identified:**
1. **Timeline Manipulation:** Peter claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 "following" the accountant's attendance. However, the actual sequence was:
   - **6 June 2025:** Daniel provided comprehensive reports to Bantjies
   - **7 June 2025:** Peter cancelled UK business cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions
   - This demonstrates Peter cancelled cards **before** any alleged discovery of irregularities, not after
   
2. **Bantjies Conflict of Interest:** Peter fails to disclose that Danie Bantjies is:
   - A **Trustee** of the Faucitt Family Trust (alongside Peter)
   - A **Debtor** to the Trust
   - The **Accountant** for the companies
   - This triple role creates an impermissible conflict of interest

3. **Card Cancellation Impact:** Peter admits subscriptions were halted but frames this as Daniel's fault for not "assisting." In reality, Peter's unilateral card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible, as systems required card-based authentication.

### 2.2 The R500,000 "Birthday Gift" (AD Paragraphs 7.16-7.20)

**Peter's Claims:**
- Jacqueline "simply re-approached the banks" and obtained duplicate/new cards on or about 24 June 2025
- Peter "discussed the transactions" with her, but she rejected any idea of malfeasance
- Jacqueline "adopted an 'I will show you' approach"
- Jacqueline transferred R500,000 to Daniel on or about 16 July 2025 as a "birthday gift"
- Peter "did not authorise" this transfer
- Daniel "was not entitled to accept" it
- Jacqueline "has no other sources of income other than her remuneration"
- This was "without my knowledge"
- The expense "cannot remotely be described as being a legitimate business expense"

**Material Non-Disclosures Identified:**
1. **Jacqueline's Role as Trustee:** Peter fails to disclose that Jacqueline is a **co-trustee** of the Faucitt Family Trust, which owns RegimA Worldwide and Villa Via. Her actions as a trustee are subject to fiduciary duties under the Trust Property Control Act, not merely as a "wife" or "director."

2. **Context of the Transfer:** Peter frames the R500,000 as a "birthday gift" to suggest impropriety, but fails to disclose:
   - The R1,035,000 debt owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance (Daniel's company)
   - These funds were part of the estate of Daniel's late partner, Kayla Pretorius
   - Jacqueline confronted Rynette Farrar about this debt on **15 May 2025**
   - The R500,000 may have been a partial payment toward this legitimate debt

### 2.3 IT Expenses Analysis (AD Paragraphs 8.1-8.10)

**Peter's Claims:**
- 2024 tax year IT expenses: **R6,738,007.47**
- 2025 tax year IT expenses (thus far): **R2,116,159.47**
- These amounts "exclude the 'birthday gift'"
- Expenses are "almost entirely unexplainable"
- "Many of the 'expenses' are also seemingly international"
- Business accounts have "almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving the Republic of South Africa"
- Corporations "will, as it stands, be unable to explain these international expenses"

**Material Non-Disclosures Identified:**
1. **Revenue Context:** Peter fails to disclose that the e-commerce operations generated **R34.9 million annually**. The IT expenses, while substantial, must be evaluated in the context of this revenue.

2. **UK Operations Funding SA Operations:** Peter claims UK entities owe money to SA operations, but the Shopify invoices demonstrate the **opposite**: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) fund SA operations to the tune of **R84,661+ annually**.

3. **Legitimate E-Commerce Expenses:** Peter characterizes IT expenses as "unexplainable" but fails to acknowledge that running a global e-commerce platform requires:
   - Shopify subscriptions
   - Domain registrations
   - Hosting services
   - Payment processing fees
   - Marketing and advertising
   - Software licenses

### 2.4 Substantial Financial Misconduct (AD Paragraphs 9.1-9.4)

**Peter's Claims:**
- The aforesaid "appears to constitute substantial financial misconduct"
- "None of the respondents (third to sixth) are resellers in technology or technological related items, or services"
- Expenses are "unrelated to the business of the applicants"
- This is "entirely due to my son, who is defended, and enabled by my wife"
- Indicates "misappropriation of substantial sums of money from the corporations"

**Material Non-Disclosures Identified:**
1. **E-Commerce Business Model:** Peter fails to disclose that the companies **are** engaged in e-commerce, which is inherently technology-dependent. The statement that they are "not resellers in technology" is misleading, as e-commerce platforms are the primary sales channel.

2. **Daniel's Role as CIO:** Peter acknowledges Daniel is responsible for "IT" but fails to disclose Daniel's role as **Chief Information Officer** and the architect of the profitable e-commerce division.

### 2.5 Delinquency and Probation Application (AD Paragraphs 10.1-10.13)

**Peter's Claims:**
- Seeks declaration of Jacqueline and Daniel as **delinquent** under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act
- Alternatively, seeks to place them under **probation** under Section 162(7)
- Alleges they have:
  - Grossly abused their positions
  - Intentionally or by gross negligence inflicted harm on the companies
  - Acted with gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or breach of trust
  - Carried on business in a manner oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to Peter's interests

**Material Non-Disclosures Identified:**
1. **Peter's Own Conduct:** Peter fails to disclose his own actions that constitute grounds for delinquency:
   - Unauthorized R900,000 transfers (14-15 February 2025)
   - Card cancellation sabotage (7 June 2025)
   - False debt claims (perjury)
   - Abuse of court process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures)

2. **Retaliation Pattern:** Peter fails to disclose the timeline of retaliation against Jacqueline:
   - **15 May 2025:** Jacqueline confronts Rynette about R1,035,000 debt
   - **29 May 2025:** Competing domain `regimaskin.co.za` registered by Adderory (Rynette's son's company)
   - **11 August 2025:** Jacqueline signs document backdating Peter's "Main Trustee" designation
   - **13 August 2025:** Jacqueline included in interdict

---

## 3. Strategic Implications for Answering Affidavits

### 3.1 Manufactured Crisis Argument
The founding affidavit demonstrates that Peter **created** the crisis he complains about:
- Cancelled cards on 7 June, rendering documentation inaccessible
- Complained about missing documentation on 6 June (the day before cancellation)
- This is a clear application of *venire contra factum proprium* (estoppel)

### 3.2 Perjury and Material Non-Disclosures
Peter's affidavit contains multiple false statements and material omissions:
- Timeline manipulation (claiming card cancellation followed discovery, when it preceded it)
- Bantjies conflict of interest (undisclosed triple role)
- UK operations debt (claiming UK owes SA, when SA is funded by UK)
- Revenue context (omitting R34.9 million annual revenue)

### 3.3 Retaliation Pattern
The founding affidavit, when cross-referenced with the timeline, reveals a clear pattern of retaliation:
- Against Jacqueline for confronting Rynette about the R1,035,000 debt
- Against Daniel for exposing fraud to Bantjies on 6 June 2025

---

## 4. Recommendations for Counter-Application

Based on this analysis, the answering affidavits should:

1. **Expose the Timeline Manipulation:** Clearly demonstrate that Peter cancelled cards **before** any alleged discovery of irregularities
2. **Highlight Bantjies Conflict:** Emphasize the material non-disclosure of Bantjies's triple role as Trustee + Debtor + Accountant
3. **Provide Revenue Context:** Show that IT expenses, while substantial, are proportionate to the R34.9 million annual revenue
4. **Refute UK Debt Claims:** Use Shopify invoices to demonstrate that UK entities fund SA operations, not the reverse
5. **Establish Retaliation Pattern:** Link Jacqueline's confrontation with Rynette (15 May) to her inclusion in the interdict (13 August)
6. **Counter-Claim for Delinquency:** Seek declaration of Peter as delinquent based on his unauthorized R900k transfers, card cancellation sabotage, perjury, and abuse of process
