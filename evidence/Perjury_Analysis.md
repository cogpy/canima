## PETER'S PERJURY: FOUR COUNTS

### COUNT 1: "Erratic Behavior" (After 165 Days of Torture)

**Peter's Statement (Founding Affidavit):**
> "My son has been acting erratically and irresponsibly in managing the companies."

**The Reality:**
- March 30, 2025: Trap (dump 2 years expenses, 12-hour deadline) - Day 1
- June 6, 2025: Daniel presents findings (68-day investigation) - Day 68
- June 7, 2025: Card cancellations (retaliation begins) - Day 69
- July 8, 2025: Warehouse sabotage (operations destroyed) - Day 100
- August 13, 2025: Interdict granted - Day 136
- August 19, 2025: Interdict delivered (Kayla's birthday) - Day 142
- September 11, 2025: Account emptying (forced failure) - Day 165

**Proof of Falsity:**
- Daniel conducted 68-day investigation (proves competence, not erratic)
- Daniel refused to sign fraudulent accounts (proves responsibility, not irresponsibility)
- Daniel still paying creditors after 6 months of sabotage (proves competence)

**Material:** Yes - Court relied on this to grant interdict  
**Knowingly False:** Yes - Peter orchestrated the torture (card cancellations, warehouse sabotage)  
**Provably False:** Yes - Timeline proves torture preceded behavior

---

### COUNT 2: "Urgency" (67-Day Delay Proves False)

**Peter's Statement (Founding Affidavit):**
> "This matter is urgent and requires immediate court intervention to prevent further damage to the companies."

**The Reality:**
- June 6, 2025: Daniel provides reports to Bantjies (cooperation)
- August 13, 2025: Interdict granted (68 days later)
- **67-DAY DELAY between "urgent" problem and court filing**

**Proof of Falsity:**
- If urgent: Why wait 67 days?
- If immediate intervention needed: Why delay?
- **Real urgency:** May 2026 (R18.685M payment due) - 10 months away

**Material:** Yes - Court granted ex parte order based on urgency  
**Knowingly False:** Yes - Peter knew he waited 67 days  
**Provably False:** Yes - Timeline proves 67-day delay

### COUNT 3: "Discovery" (System Logs Prove 4-Year Knowledge)

**Peter's Statement (Founding Affidavit):**

---

### COUNT 4: "Financial Oversight" (Warehouse Sabotage Proves Destruction Intent)

**Peter's Statement (Founding Affidavit):**
> "I seek this interdict to protect the companies from further financial mismanagement and to restore proper financial oversight."

**The Reality:**
- July 8, 2025: Peter instructed warehouse to STOP SHOPIFY ORDERS
- Impact: R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse)
- POPI violations: 10 years imprisonment + R10M fine per violation
- **If Peter wanted "financial oversight" → Request reports (June 6 ✓)**
- **Instead: DESTROYED R34.9M OPERATIONS**

**Proof of Falsity:**

- **Actions contradict stated intent**

**Material:** Yes - Court granted interdict to "protect companies"  
**Knowingly False:** Yes - Peter knew he destroyed operations (not protected)

## THE CURATORSHIP FRAUD CONNECTION

### How Perjury Advances Curatorship Fraud

**Step 1: Obtain Interdict (Through Perjury)**
- False statements: "Erratic behavior", "Urgency", "Discovery", "Financial oversight"
- Court grants interdict (based on false statements)
- Daniel loses operational control

**Step 2: Force Failure (Through Sabotage)**
- Warehouse sabotage (July 8, 2025)
- Account emptying (September 11, 2025)
- Card cancellations (June 7, 2025)
- **Zero revenue + All liabilities = Forced insolvency**

**Step 3: Seek Curatorship (Through "Incompetence")**
- Point to forced failure as "proof" of incompetence
- Medical testing scheduled (day before Jacqui's mom's birthday)
- "Arbitrary expert" to diagnose "mental illness" for disagreeing with Peter
- **Curatorship granted → Bantjies controls everything**

**Step 4: Secure Payment (Through Control)**
- Bantjies controls trust (trustee)
- Bantjies controls companies (curator)
- Bantjies controls assets (administrator)
- **R18.685M payment secured (May 2026)**
