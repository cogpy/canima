## Introduction

This document provides an analysis of statements made under oath in the founding affidavit of Peter Andrew Faucitt and the certification by the Commissioner of Oaths, Danie Bantjies. The analysis compares these statements with available evidence and highlights potential discrepancies.

## Legal Framework for Statements Under Oath

In South African law, a statement made under oath, such as in an affidavit, is subject to legal scrutiny. A false statement made under oath can have serious legal consequences. For a statement to be considered perjurious, it must be:

1.  Made under oath in a legal proceeding.
2.  Material to the matter being decided.
3.  Proven to be false.
4.  Made with the knowledge that it was false.

## Analysis of Peter Faucitt's Founding Affidavit

### 1. Allegation of "Erratic Behavior"

**Statement in Affidavit:**
> "My son has been acting erratically and irresponsibly in managing the companies."

**Evidence for Consideration:**
*   **March 30, 2025:** A large volume of unprocessed transactions spanning two years is presented to Daniel Faucitt with a request for processing within 12 hours.
*   **June 6, 2025:** After a 68-day period of analysis, Daniel Faucitt presents his findings regarding the financial records.
*   **June 7, 2025:** Company credit cards are cancelled.
*   **July 8, 2025:** An instruction is given to the warehouse to stop processing Shopify orders.
*   **September 11, 2025:** Company bank accounts are emptied.

**Analysis:**
The "erratic behavior" alleged by the Applicant should be evaluated in the context of the timeline of events. The Respondent's actions, including the 68-day investigation and refusal to sign off on financial statements, can be interpreted as responsible rather than erratic. The timeline suggests that the Respondent's behavior was a reaction to the events that were unfolding.

### 2. Allegation of "Urgency"

**Statement in Affidavit:**
> "This matter is urgent and requires immediate court intervention to prevent further damage to the companies."

**Evidence for Consideration:**
*   **June 6, 2025:** Daniel Faucitt provides his reports to Danie Bantjies.
*   **August 13, 2025:** The interdict is granted, 68 days after the reports were provided.

**Analysis:**
The 67-day delay between the date the respondent's reports were provided and the date the interdict was sought raises questions about the claimed urgency of the matter.

### 3. Allegation of "Recent Discovery"

**Statement in Affidavit:**
> "I recently discovered that my son has been mismanaging the companies and making unauthorized expenditures."

**Evidence for Consideration:**
*   **2017:** Daniel Faucitt was involved in the Shopify Plus onboarding process.
*   **2017-2025:** The Shopify stores generated significant revenue.
*   **2021:** Danie Bantjies was appointed as the accountant and had access to financial records.
*   **2024:** Danie Bantjies was appointed as a trustee and had access to all trust records.

**Analysis:**
The evidence suggests a long-standing involvement of the key parties in the business operations and access to financial information for several years, which may contradict the claim of a "recent discovery" of mismanagement.

### 4. Allegation of Seeking "Financial Oversight"

**Statement in Affidavit:**
> "I seek this interdict to protect the companies from further financial mismanagement and to restore proper financial oversight."

**Evidence for Consideration:**
*   **July 8, 2025:** An instruction was given to the warehouse to stop processing Shopify orders, which resulted in a near-total collapse of revenue.

**Analysis:**
The action of stopping warehouse operations appears to be in direct contradiction with the stated goal of protecting the companies and restoring financial oversight. A more direct approach to gaining oversight would have been to request financial reports or exercise the powers of a co-director to access bank accounts.

## Analysis of Danie Bantjies' Certification

### 1. Alleged "No Knowledge of Crimes"

**Statement (as Commissioner of Oaths):**
> "I certify that the deponent has acknowledged that he knows and understands the contents of this affidavit."

**Evidence for Consideration:**
*   **June 6, 2025:** Daniel Faucitt presents his findings of financial irregularities to Danie Bantjies.
*   **August 13, 2025:** Danie Bantjies certifies Peter Faucitt's affidavit.

**Analysis:**
By certifying the affidavit without disclosing the information presented on June 6, Mr. Bantjies may have made a material omission.

### 2. Alleged "No Conflicts of Interest"

**Statement (implied by certification):**
By certifying the affidavit, a Commissioner of Oaths implies that they are acting impartially.

**Evidence for Consideration:**
Danie Bantjies held multiple roles that could be perceived as conflicts of interest:
1.  **Creditor:** He is a significant creditor to the Faucitt Family Trust.
2.  **Trustee:** He was a trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.
3.  **Accountant:** He was the accountant for the RegimA companies.
4.  **Commissioner of Oaths:** He certified the affidavit used in the legal proceedings.

**Analysis:**
The multiple roles held by Mr. Bantjies could be seen as conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed.

## Conclusion

This analysis has highlighted several statements in the founding affidavit and the certification that may be inconsistent with the available evidence. These discrepancies should be carefully considered in the legal proceedings. The court will need to determine whether these statements were made with the intent to mislead and whether they were material to the granting of the interdict.
