# WAREHOUSE FRAUD & PERJURY: CENTRAL EVIDENCE ANALYSIS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The warehouse fraud and perjury are not peripheral issues—they are **CENTRAL SMOKING GUNS** that expose the entire criminal conspiracy orchestrated by Bantjies (trustee) through Rynette (administrator) and Peter (puppet).

**Two irrefutable proofs of criminal intent:**

1. **WAREHOUSE FRAUD (July 8, 2025):** Peter instructed warehouse to stop supplying Shopify orders, sabotaging R34.9M operations
2. **PERJURY (Multiple instances):** Peter and Bantjies made false statements under oath to obtain interdict and curatorship

---

## PART 1: WAREHOUSE FRAUD EVIDENCE

### 1.1 THE JULY 8, 2025 WAREHOUSE SABOTAGE

**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Action:** Peter instructed warehouse employees to stop using Shopify for customer orders  
**Impact:** Complete operational shutdown of R34.9M annual business  
**Legal Violations:** POPI Act, business sabotage, tortious interference  

#### Documentary Evidence

**Primary Source:** Daniel Faucitt compliance directive (July 8, 2025)  
**Location:** `/jax-response/revenue-theft/08-july-warehouse-popi/`  
**Subject:** URGENT: MANDATORY COMPLIANCE DIRECTIVE - PERSONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY WARNING

#### Peter's Illegal Instructions to Employees

1. **Stop using Shopify for customer orders**
2. **Use unauthorized domains for company business**
3. **Process customer data outside approved systems**

#### Business Impact

| Account | Annual Revenue | Impact |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| RegimA SA | R 8,504,213.82 | 100% shutdown (ZERO revenue June-Aug 2025) |
| RegimA WW + Zone | R 26,447,551.48 | 72.8% drop (R2.27M → R0.73M/month) |
| **TOTAL** | **R 34,951,765.30** | **93.3% revenue collapse** |

### 1.2 LEGAL VIOLATIONS

#### A. POPI Act Violations (Protection of Personal Information Act)

**Criminal Penalties:**
- Unauthorized access to customer data: **Up to 10 years imprisonment**
- Processing data outside approved systems: **Up to R10 million fine**
- Each violation is a separate criminal offense
- "Following orders" provides NO legal defense

**Compliance Facts:**
- Customer data belongs to RegimA Distribution companies (NOT RegimA Skin Treatments)
- RegimA Skin Treatments employees are unauthorized third parties
- Only Shopify has legal authorization to process customer information
- Alternative domains lack required security and compliance measures

#### B. Business Sabotage

**Companies Act 71 of 2008 - Section 76:**
- Director breach of fiduciary duty through systematic operational destruction
- Personal liability, disqualification, criminal charges

**Common Law:**
- Malicious damage to property and business operations
- Tortious interference with business relations

#### C. Employee Endangerment

**Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995:**
- Unfair labor practices through illegal instructions
- Exposing employees to personal criminal liability
- Director misconduct creating employee legal jeopardy

### 1.3 TIMELINE CONTEXT

**Warehouse sabotage occurred in coordinated sequence:**

- **May 22, 2025:** Shopify audit trail destruction (47 days before)
- **June 7, 2025:** Card cancellations (31 days before)
- **June 20, 2025:** Client diversion (18 days before)
- **July 8, 2025:** **WAREHOUSE SABOTAGE**
- **July 10, 2025:** Shopify invoice fails (2 days after)
- **August 13, 2025:** Interdict granted (36 days after)

**This proves PREMEDITATED COORDINATION:**
1. Destroy evidence (May 22)
2. Cancel payment methods (June 7)
3. Divert clients (June 20)
4. Stop warehouse operations (July 8)
5. Force platform failure (July 10)
6. Obtain legal control (August 13)

### 1.4 CRIMINAL INTENT PROVEN

**The warehouse sabotage proves Peter's intent was NOT "financial oversight" but BUSINESS DESTRUCTION:**

**If Peter wanted financial control, he would:**
- Request financial reports ✓ (June 6 - Dan provided)
- Review documentation ✓ (Available)
- Discuss concerns ✗ (Never attempted)
- Use trust powers ✗ (Never used)
- Seek mediation ✗ (Rejected)

**Instead, Peter chose:**
- Destroy evidence (May 22)
- Cancel cards (June 7)
- Divert clients (June 20)
- **Stop warehouse operations (July 8)**
- Obtain interdict (August 13)

**This is not oversight - this is SABOTAGE.**

## PART 2: PERJURY EVIDENCE

### 2.1 PETER'S PERJURY: "ERRATIC BEHAVIOR" CLAIM

#### The False Statement

**Peter's Affidavit (August 13, 2025):**
> "Daniel's behavior has been erratic lately..."

#### The Reality: 165 Days of Systematic Torture

**March 1 - August 13, 2025 = 165 days of escalating attacks:**

| Date | Attack | Days Since Start | Peter's Action |
|------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| March 1, 2025 | Revenue diversion begins | Day 1 | Orchestrates hijacking |
| March 30, 2025 | Curatorship application | Day 29 | Files legal attack |
| May 22, 2025 | Shopify audit deletion | Day 82 | Destroys evidence |
| June 7, 2025 | Card cancellations | Day 98 | Financial strangulation |
| June 20, 2025 | Client diversion | Day 111 | Revenue collapse |
| July 8, 2025 | Warehouse sabotage | Day 129 | Operational shutdown |
| July 10, 2025 | Shopify invoice fails | Day 131 | Platform failure |
| **August 13, 2025** | **Claims "erratic"** | **Day 165** | **PERJURY** |

#### The Gaslighting Strategy

**Peter's strategy:**
1. **Torture for 165 days** (revenue hijacking, evidence destruction, card cancellations, warehouse sabotage)
2. **Observe victim's distress** (natural human reaction to systematic destruction)
3. **Label victim "erratic"** (gaslight the natural response to torture)
4. **Use "erratic behavior" as evidence** (justify interdict, curatorship, control)

**This is classic abuser psychology:**
- Provoke the victim
- Document the victim's reaction
- Use the reaction as "proof" of instability
- Gain control through false narrative

#### The Problem: Daniel Wasn't Erratic

**If Daniel had been truly "erratic," he would have:**
- Abandoned the businesses ✗
- Given up on the platform ✗
- Stopped trying to save operations ✗
- Collapsed under psychological pressure ✗

**Daniel's actual behavior:**
- Continued operating businesses despite 93.3% revenue drop ✓
- Continued trying to pay bills despite account emptying ✓
- Continued trying to save platform despite systematic destruction ✓
- **Remained rational and focused for 244+ days** ✓

**Peter needed the "erratic" claim because Daniel's RATIONAL response exposed the conspiracy.**

### 2.2 PETER'S PERJURY: "URGENCY" CLAIM

#### The False Statement

**Peter's Affidavit (August 13, 2025):**
> "Urgent relief is required to prevent further financial harm..."

#### The Reality: 2-Month Delay Proves No Urgency

**Timeline of "Urgency":**

- **June 6, 2025:** Dan provides reports to accountant (cooperation)
- **June 7, 2025:** Peter cancels cards (creates crisis)
- **June 7-August 13, 2025:** **67 days pass** (no action)
- **August 6, 2025:** Settlement agreement signed
- **August 13, 2025:** Interdict filed (7 days after settlement)
- **May 2026:** Investment payout due (9 months away)

**If there was genuine urgency:**
- Peter would have acted immediately (June 7)
- Peter would not have waited 67 days
- Peter would not have signed settlement 7 days before interdict
- Peter would not be waiting 9 months for investment payout

**The 67-day delay PROVES:**
- No genuine urgency existed
- Peter manufactured the crisis
- The interdict was strategic (settlement leverage)
- The "urgency" claim is **PERJURY**

### 2.3 PETER'S PERJURY: "DISCOVERY" CLAIM

#### The False Statement

**Peter's Affidavit (August 13, 2025):**
> "I recently discovered financial irregularities..."

#### The Reality: System Logs Prove Continuous Knowledge

**Evidence of Peter's Continuous Knowledge:**

1. **Email Access:** Pete@regima.com (controlled by Rynette)
2. **System Logs:** Continuous access to all company communications
3. **Financial Reports:** Regular receipt of financial information
4. **Accountant Meetings:** Regular updates on company finances

**Rynette (Administrator) had:**
- Complete email access (Pete@regima.com)
- Banking access (all company accounts)
- System administrator privileges
- Real-time visibility of all transactions

**Timeline Proves Knowledge:**

- **2021-2025:** Rynette had continuous system access (4 years)
- **March 1, 2025:** Revenue diversion begins (Peter orchestrates)
- **March 30, 2025:** Curatorship application (Peter files)
- **June 7, 2025:** Card cancellations (Peter executes)
- **August 13, 2025:** Claims "recently discovered" (**PERJURY**)

**Peter cannot claim "discovery" when:**
- Rynette had 4 years of system access
- Peter orchestrated March 1 revenue diversion
- Peter filed March 30 curatorship application
- Peter cancelled June 7 cards

**The "discovery" claim is demonstrably FALSE.**

### 2.4 BANTJIES PERJURY: "NO KNOWLEDGE OF CRIMES" CLAIM

#### The False Statement

**Bantjies Affidavit (August 14, 2025):**
> "I had no knowledge of any criminal matters when I filed this affidavit..."

#### The Reality: 65-Day Timeline Proves Knowledge

**Timeline of Bantjies' Knowledge:**

- **June 10, 2025 AM:** Peter tells Bantjies about "R10M irregularities"
- **June 10, 2025 PM:** Bantjies dismisses as "holiday matter"
- **June 10 - August 14, 2025:** **65 days pass**
- **August 14, 2025:** Bantjies files affidavit claiming "no knowledge"

**Documentary Evidence:**

1. **Email Evidence:** June 10 communication between Peter and Bantjies
2. **Witness Testimony:** Daniel's account of June 10 meeting
3. **Timeline Analysis:** 65-day gap between knowledge and affidavit
4. **ENS Africa Letter:** August 29 acknowledgment of criminal matters

**Bantjies' Affidavit Claims:**
- "No knowledge of criminal matters" ✗ FALSE
- "Acting in good faith" ✗ FALSE
- "Urgent relief required" ✗ FALSE (65-day delay)

**The 65-day gap PROVES:**
- Bantjies knew about criminal matters on June 10
- Bantjies waited 65 days before filing affidavit
- Bantjies deliberately concealed knowledge in affidavit
- Bantjies committed **PERJURY**

#### Legal Significance

**Perjury Elements (All Met):**

1. **Material False Statement:** "No knowledge of criminal matters"
2. **Made Under Oath:** Affidavit filed with court
3. **Knowledge of Falsity:** June 10 meeting proves knowledge
4. **Intent to Deceive:** Deliberate concealment in affidavit

**Criminal Exposure:**
- **Perjury:** 15 years imprisonment per count
- **Professional Misconduct:** Disbarment as accountant
- **Trustee Breach:** Removal as trustee, personal liability

## PART 3: WAREHOUSE FRAUD + PERJURY = CONSPIRACY PROOF

### 3.1 THE COORDINATED PATTERN

**Warehouse fraud and perjury are not isolated incidents—they are COORDINATED ELEMENTS of a single conspiracy:**

#### Phase 1: Preparation (March-June 2025)
- **March 1:** Revenue diversion begins
- **March 30:** Curatorship application filed
- **May 22:** Evidence destruction (Shopify audit)
- **June 7:** Card cancellations
- **June 10:** Bantjies learns of crimes (then conceals)

#### Phase 2: Execution (July-August 2025)
- **July 8:** **WAREHOUSE SABOTAGE** (operational shutdown)
- **July 10:** Shopify invoice fails (platform collapse)
- **August 6:** Settlement signed (strategic positioning)
- **August 13:** Interdict obtained (legal control)
- **August 14:** Bantjies files affidavit (**PERJURY**)

#### Phase 3: Consolidation (September 2025)
- **September 11:** R16.08M account emptying (forced insolvency)
- **September 18:** "Medical testing" scam (false narrative)
- **October 31:** Dan & Jax still fighting (244 days of torture)

### 3.2 THE SMOKING GUNS

**Warehouse Fraud Proves:**
1. **Intent to Destroy** (not manage)
2. **Premeditated Coordination** (timeline sequence)
3. **Criminal Knowledge** (POPI violations)
4. **Consciousness of Guilt** (evidence destruction first)

**Perjury Proves:**
1. **False Narrative** (erratic, urgency, discovery)
2. **Deliberate Deception** (Bantjies 65-day concealment)
3. **Legal Process Abuse** (interdict through lies)
4. **Criminal Intent** (perjury to obtain control)

**Together They Prove:**
- **Bantjies orchestrated** (trustee with ultimate power)
- **Rynette executed** (administrator with system access)
- **Peter fronted** (puppet making false claims)
- **Conspiracy to defraud** (coordinated criminal enterprise)

### 3.3 WHY THESE ARE CENTRAL (NOT PERIPHERAL)

**Traditional View:**
- Warehouse sabotage = "business dispute"
- Perjury = "exaggeration in litigation"
- Separate incidents = "coincidence"

**Reality:**
- Warehouse sabotage = **PREMEDITATED BUSINESS DESTRUCTION**
- Perjury = **CRIMINAL FRAUD TO OBTAIN LEGAL CONTROL**
- Coordinated timing = **PROOF OF CONSPIRACY**

**The warehouse fraud and perjury are central because:**

1. **They prove intent:** Not financial oversight, but destruction
2. **They prove coordination:** Timeline shows premeditation
3. **They prove conspiracy:** Multiple actors, single plan
4. **They prove criminal enterprise:** Systematic, organized, deliberate

**Without warehouse fraud:** Could argue "financial concern"  
**Without perjury:** Could argue "good faith litigation"  
**With both:** Can ONLY conclude **CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY**

## PART 4: INTEGRATION WITH ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT

### 4.1 WAREHOUSE FRAUD PARAGRAPHS

**Recommended Additions to Answering Affidavit:**

#### Section: Business Sabotage (New)

**PARA X.1:** On July 8, 2025, Peter instructed warehouse employees to stop using Shopify for customer orders, constituting deliberate business sabotage.

**PARA X.2:** This instruction violated the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) by requiring unauthorized processing of customer data outside approved systems.

**PARA X.3:** The warehouse sabotage caused immediate operational shutdown:
- RegimA SA: 100% revenue collapse (ZERO revenue June-August 2025)
- RegimA WW + Zone: 72.8% revenue drop (R2.27M → R0.73M/month)
- Total impact: R34.9M annual operations destroyed

**PARA X.4:** The timing proves premeditation:
- 47 days after evidence destruction (May 22)
- 31 days after card cancellations (June 7)
- 18 days after client diversion (June 20)
- 2 days before Shopify invoice failure (July 10)
- 36 days before interdict (August 13)

**PARA X.5:** This was not financial oversight—this was systematic business destruction designed to force insolvency and justify legal control.

### 4.2 PERJURY PARAGRAPHS

**Recommended Additions to Answering Affidavit:**

#### Section: Material False Statements (New)

**PARA Y.1:** Peter's claim that "Daniel's behavior has been erratic" is false and constitutes perjury.

**PARA Y.2:** The reality is that Daniel endured 165 days of systematic torture (March 1 - August 13, 2025) including:
- Revenue hijacking
- Evidence destruction
- Card cancellations
- Client diversion
- Warehouse sabotage
- Platform failure

**PARA Y.3:** Daniel's response was not "erratic" but RATIONAL—he continued operating businesses, paying bills, and trying to save operations despite 93.3% revenue collapse.

**PARA Y.4:** Peter's "erratic behavior" claim is classic gaslighting: provoke the victim, document the reaction, use the reaction as "proof" of instability.

**PARA Y.5:** Peter's claim of "urgency" is false—the 67-day delay between card cancellation (June 7) and interdict (August 13) proves no genuine urgency existed.

**PARA Y.6:** Peter's claim of "recent discovery" is false—system logs prove Rynette (administrator) had continuous access for 4 years, and Peter orchestrated the March 1 revenue diversion.

**PARA Y.7:** Bantjies' claim of "no knowledge of criminal matters" is false—the June 10 meeting proves Bantjies knew about crimes 65 days before filing the affidavit.

**PARA Y.8:** These material false statements constitute perjury under South African law, carrying exposure of 15 years imprisonment per count.

### 4.3 CONSPIRACY PROOF PARAGRAPHS

**Recommended Additions to Answering Affidavit:**

#### Section: Criminal Conspiracy (New)

**PARA Z.1:** The warehouse fraud and perjury are not isolated incidents—they are coordinated elements of a criminal conspiracy orchestrated by Bantjies (trustee) through Rynette (administrator) and Peter (puppet).

**PARA Z.2:** The timeline proves premeditation:
- March-June: Preparation (revenue diversion, evidence destruction, card cancellations)
- July-August: Execution (warehouse sabotage, perjury, interdict)
- September: Consolidation (account emptying, forced insolvency)

**PARA Z.3:** The warehouse fraud proves intent to destroy (not manage), premeditated coordination, and consciousness of guilt.

**PARA Z.4:** The perjury proves false narrative, deliberate deception, legal process abuse, and criminal intent.

**PARA Z.5:** Together, they prove Bantjies orchestrated, Rynette executed, and Peter fronted a conspiracy to defraud Daniel and Jacqui of R208M platform and Ubuntu vision.
