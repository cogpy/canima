# Shopify Invoice Analysis: UK Funding of ZA Operations

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Case:** 2025-137857 (Peter Faucitt v. Jacqueline & Daniel Faucitt)

---

## Introduction

This document analyzes the Shopify invoices to demonstrate that the UK-based entities were funding the South African (ZA) operations and that the associated costs should be understood as ecosystem-wide expenses rather than isolated ZA company expenses. This analysis provides critical context for the financial structure of the business and refutes allegations of mismanagement.

## Key Findings

1.  **UK Funding Source:** The Shopify invoices were paid in USD using UK-based business and personal cards, providing clear evidence that the UK entities were the source of funding for the Shopify platform.

2.  **Ecosystem Expense:** The Shopify platform, with its 51+ stores and significant annual revenue, was a shared resource for the entire business ecosystem, including both UK and ZA entities. The costs associated with this platform should therefore be considered an ecosystem-wide expense, not solely a ZA expense.

3.  **Ubuntu Principle in Practice:** The UK funding of the Shopify platform is a clear example of the "Ubuntu Principle" in action, where revenue generated from the UK-based platform was used to support and sustain the ZA operations.

4.  **Documented Financial Strategy:** The consistent payment of Shopify invoices from UK sources over a period of several years demonstrates a deliberate and well-documented financial strategy, not mismanagement.

## Conclusion

The Shopify invoices provide clear and compelling evidence that the UK entities were funding the ZA operations through the Shopify platform. This was not mismanagement, but a deliberate and documented business strategy designed to support the entire ecosystem. The expenses associated with the Shopify platform should be understood as ecosystem-wide investments, not isolated ZA company expenses. This evidence is critical to understanding the true financial structure of the business and refuting the false allegations of mismanagement.
