# Shopify Invoice Analysis: UK/ZA Funding, Client Migration, and Deliberate Sabotage

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Case:** 2025-137857 (Peter Faucitt v. Jacqueline & Daniel Faucitt)

---

## Introduction

This document analyzes the Shopify invoices to demonstrate a deliberate, multi-year strategy to migrate clients and revenue streams to South African (ZA) company platforms, in line with the "Ubuntu Principle." It further shows how this migration was deliberately sabotaged by the Applicant, Peter Faucitt, through the cancellation of ZA business cards, providing clear evidence of his destructive intent.

## Key Findings

1.  **Client Migration Strategy:** There was a clear and active strategy to migrate clients from UK-based platforms to ZA-based platforms (RegimA SA and RegimA Zone). This was a practical implementation of the Ubuntu Principle, designed to bolster the financial stability of the ZA companies.

2.  **Deliberate Sabotage:** On June 7, 2025, one day after Daniel Faucitt presented evidence of fraud, Peter Faucitt secretly cancelled the ZA business cards that funded the ZA Shopify platforms. This act directly sabotaged the client migration process, halting it mid-stream and preventing the ZA companies from receiving the intended revenue.

3.  **Multiple Funding Sources:** The Shopify ecosystem was funded by a combination of UK and ZA business and personal cards, demonstrating a shared financial responsibility and a complex, integrated financial structure.

4.  **UK Funding of Largest Operation:** The largest single operation, RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWW), which has generated over ZAR 60 million in revenue, has been funded by a UK business card since July 2023, further demonstrating the UK's financial support for the ecosystem.

## The Client Migration and its Sabotage

### The Ubuntu Principle in Action

The migration of clients to the ZA company platforms was a direct implementation of the Ubuntu Principle, a strategy to attribute UK-generated revenue to the ZA companies to ensure their financial stability. This was a multi-year effort to build a sustainable and self-sufficient ZA operation.

### Peter Faucitt's Deliberate Sabotage

On June 7, 2025, Peter Faucitt took the following actions:

*   **Cancelled ZA Business Cards:** He secretly cancelled the two ZA business cards (ending in 5191 and 5225) that were funding the RegimA SA and RegimA Zone Shopify platforms.
*   **Halted the Migration:** This action immediately halted the client migration process, as the ZA platforms could no longer process payments.
*   **Severed Revenue Streams:** By cancelling the cards, he severed the ZA company's direct financial link to these revenue streams, effectively destroying the Ubuntu Principle implementation.

This act of sabotage is critical evidence of the applicant's destructive intent. It was a deliberate act to harm the business operations he claimed to be protecting, and its timing—one day after being presented with evidence of fraud—is highly indicative of retaliatory intent.

## Conclusion

The Shopify invoices, when viewed in the context of the client migration strategy, provide a powerful narrative of deliberate sabotage. The evidence clearly shows a multi-year effort to build a sustainable ZA operation, which was intentionally destroyed by Peter Faucitt's actions. This was not an act of protection, but a calculated move to harm the business and undermine the financial stability of the ZA companies. This evidence is critical to refuting the applicant's claims and demonstrating his true intent to the court the true nature of his actions.
